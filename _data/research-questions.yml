  id: "MQ"
  question: "How can FabricAir access used high-quality polyester fibers in Finland to realize its ambitions to develop 100% circular polyester sourcing for its ventilation system?"
  scope: "Finland"
  context: |
    FabricAir needs external feedstock of high-quality polyester fibers to supplement
    their internal process waste (~30 tonnes/year) and achieve their circular sourcing goals.
    The target is durable workwear/uniforms with coarse fibers, preferably white.
