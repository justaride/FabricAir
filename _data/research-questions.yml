  question: "How can FabricAir access used high-quality polyester fibers in the Nordic region to realize its ambitions to develop 100% circular polyester sourcing for its ventilation system?"
  scope: "Finland, Sweden, Norway"
  status: "verified"
  completion: 92
  context: |
    FabricAir needs external feedstock of high-quality polyester fibers to supplement
    their internal process waste (~30 tonnes/year) and achieve their circular sourcing goals.
    The target is durable workwear/uniforms with coarse fibers, preferably white.
    Research covers all three Nordic markets with focus on identifying recycling partners
    and feedstock sources.
