# Nordic compatibility assessment
nordic_compatibility:
  critical_finding: |
    Most Nordic workwear is 65% polyester / 35% cotton blends,
    which are NOT compatible with FabricAir requirements.
    Target cleanroom, healthcare white coats, and food processing
    for 100% polyester sources.

  compatible_sources:
    - source: "Hospital white coats"
      composition: "100% polyester"
      suitable: true

    - source: "Cleanroom garments"
      composition: "99% PET / 1% carbon"
      suitable: true

    - source: "Food industry uniforms"
      composition: "Often 100% polyester"
      suitable: true

    - source: "Hotel linens"
