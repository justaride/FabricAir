## Key Findings

### Cleanroom Textile Composition (CONFIRMED)

| Material | Composition | FabricAir Compatible |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Standard ESD | **99% polyester / 1% carbon fiber** | ✅ YES |
| High ESD | **98% polyester / 2% carbon fiber** | ✅ YES |
| C-3 Fabric | 99% filament polyester + 1% carbon | ✅ YES |
| Integrity 1800 | Static dissipative polyester | ✅ YES |

> **Confirmed:** Cleanroom garments are 98-99% polyester with 1-2% carbon fiber for ESD protection. This composition is **compatible** with FabricAir's 100% PET requirement (carbon fiber content is negligible).

### Standards & Specifications

| Standard | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| ISO 4 (Class 10) | Highest cleanroom grade |
| IEST-RP-CC052 | Cleanroom garment standard |
| ANSI ESDS.2020 | ESD protection standard |
| EN 1149-3/5 | European ESD standard |
| IEC 61340-5-1 | International ESD standard |

## Validation Checklist

### Must Verify Before Engagement

- [ ] Confirm cleanroom employee count at each company
- [ ] Verify garment composition (99% PET / 1% carbon)
- [ ] Identify current disposal route
- [ ] Find facilities/waste decision-maker
- [ ] Determine annual garment replacement volume

### Questions for Cleanroom Companies

1. How many cleanroom garments do you use annually?
2. What is the material composition? (99% PET / 1% carbon?)
3. What color are the garments? (White?)
4. What happens to end-of-life garments currently?
5. Who manages workwear disposal decisions?
6. Would you consider a recycling partnership?
7. Who is your current textile service provider?

| Okmetic | TBD | ❌ Not identified |
| Murata | TBD | ❌ Not identified |
| AstraZeneca | Via Elis Sweden | ⚠️ Indirect |
| Takeda | TBD | ❌ Not identified |

## Recommended Next Steps

### Priority 1: AstraZeneca (Largest Volume)
- Contact via Elis Sweden (Patrik Nyholm)
- Request material specs and disposal route
- Potential 10-20 t/yr

### Priority 2: Orion (Most Accessible)
- Verify Carolina Sved contact
- Finnish company = easier engagement
- Potential 3-5 t/yr

### Priority 3: Okmetic (Growing Fast)
- New €400M facility = major expansion
- 500+ new employees = growing volume
- Identify facilities contact

---

## Conclusion

**Cleanroom sector is CONFIRMED compatible** with FabricAir requirements:
- 98-99% polyester + 1-2% carbon fiber
- >90% white garments
- Known composition, traceable

**Volume is LOWER than originally estimated:**
- Original: 50-150 t/yr
- Revised: 30-60 t/yr (realistic)

**Recommendation:** Pursue AstraZeneca (largest) and Orion (most accessible) first.
