## Key Findings

### Leadership (UPDATED)

| Position | Name | Since | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **CEO** | Joachim Colliander | Feb 2024 | New leadership |
| Chair of Board | Outi Luukko | 2022 | Founder, transitioned from CEO |
| Previous CEO | Miska Paulorinne | Sep 2022 - Feb 2024 | 18-month tenure |
| Contact | Seija Forss | — | Material Manager (via Lindström) |

> **⚠️ Correction:** Previous documents listed "Jukka Pesola" as CEO. This was incorrect. Jukka Pesola is CEO of Pure Waste, not Rester.

### Capacity

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Current capacity | 6,000 t/yr | [Sitra](https://www.sitra.fi/en/cases/rester-is-finlands-first-large-scale-textile-recycling-plant-we-want-to-revolutionise-the-raw-materials-of-textiles-in-industry/) |
| Combined LSJH+Rester | 12,000 t/yr | [Goodnews Finland](https://www.goodnewsfinland.com/en/articles/breaking-news/2021/largest-textile-recycling-centre-in-nordics-opens-in-finland/) |
| Total facility capacity | 12,000,000 kg/yr | Rester website |
| Expansion plans | "Looking to expand rapidly" | Outi Luukko quote |

### Ownership Structure

| Owner | Stake | Significance |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| Touchpoint Oy | 51% (majority) | FabricAir-friendly |
| Lindström Group | Significant minority | **RISK: May lock capacity** |
| Other investors | Remaining | 2022 funding round |

### Key Risk: Lindström Capacity Lock

**Concern:**
- Lindström became 2nd largest shareholder in March 2022
- Lindström controls 50-70% of Finnish textile services market
- Lindström goal: 100% textile recycling by 2025
- **Unknown:** How much Rester capacity is committed to Lindström?

**Quote from Seija Forss (Lindström Material Manager):**
> "Collaboration with Rester helps us achieve our goal to recycle all our end-of-life textiles by 2025"

**Implication:** Lindström may have preferential capacity access as shareholder.

Subject: FabricAir Partnership Inquiry - 100% Circular Polyester

Dear Joachim Colliander,

I am writing on behalf of FabricAir, a Danish manufacturer of textile
ventilation systems seeking 100% recycled polyester for our circular
production goals.

We understand Rester is the leading mechanical textile recycler in the
Nordics and would like to explore partnership opportunities.

Specifically, we would like to understand:
1. Your current available capacity for new partnerships
2. Ability to process 100% white polyester workwear
3. Output fiber quality specifications
4. Pricing and volume requirements

FabricAir requires ~300 g/m² 100% PET feedstock, ideally white or
light-colored for maximum flexibility.

Would you be available for a brief call to discuss potential collaboration?

Best regards,
[Name]
FabricAir / NCC Nordic Circular Construction
