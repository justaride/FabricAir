# Critical Assessment: Project Delivery vs. Requirements

**Assessment Date:** 2025-11-29
**Assessor:** Project Team (Self-Assessment)
**Purpose:** Honest evaluation of whether we delivered what FabricAir asked for

---

## Original Requirements

### The Main Question

> "How can Fabric Air access used high quality polyester fibers in Finland to realise its ambitions to develop 100% circular polyester sourcing for its ventilation system?"

### The Six Sub-Questions

1. What sectors/actors use high-quality polyester fibers (durable uniforms, workwear, preferably white)?
2. Who are the main stakeholders in production, use, and reuse?
3. How are polyester textiles disposed of today? What are reuse levels?
4. What regulations govern disposal/reuse? How will they evolve?
5. What public/private initiatives exist? Status, ambition, contacts?
6. **Top 10 most promising sources with contact persons responsible for disposal**

### Key Specifications (from project briefing)

- Material: **100% polyester** (not blends)
- Quality: **High durability** fibers suitable for weaving ventilation ducts
- Color: **White preferred** (for re-dyeing flexibility)
- Typical sources: Industrial workwear, hospital uniforms, road authority clothing

**Gap:**
- Ambition levels (growth targets, investment plans) only partially documented
- Research initiatives (VTT PESCO-UP) mentioned but not deeply explored

**Verdict:** 🟢 **DELIVERED** — Good initiative mapping with critical update discovered.

---

### Q6: Top 10 Sources with Contact Persons

| Criterion | Required | Delivered | Assessment |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 10 prioritized sources | Yes | Yes | 10 ranked |
| Contact persons named | Yes | Partial | Some named, some general |
| "Persons responsible for disposal" | Critical | **WEAK** | See below |
| Emails verified | Important | Partial | Mixed verification |
| Phone numbers | Important | Partial | Some provided |

**What We Delivered:**

| Rank | Organization | Contact Person | Email | Verified |
|------|--------------|----------------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Rester | Jukka Pesola (CEO) | hello@rester.fi | General |
| 2 | Touchpoint | Noora Salonoja (CEO) | noora.salonoja@touchpoint.fi | 🟢 Yes |
| 3 | Puro | Paavo Martikainen (CEO) | paavo.martikainen@puro.fi | 🟢 Yes |
| 4 | Lindström | Kati Pallasaho (SVP) | kati.pallasaho@lindstromgroup.com | 🟢 Yes |
| 5 | Image Wear | Jari Lepistö (CEO) | jari.lepisto@imagewear.fi | 🟢 Yes |
| 6 | SOL Group | Marja Innanen | marja.innanen@sol.fi | 🟡 Partial |
| 7 | Orion | Carolina Sved | carolina.sved@orion.fi | 🔴 Unverified |
| 8 | Valio | Hanna Hiekkamies | hanna.hiekkamies@valio.fi | 🔴 Unverified |
| 9 | LSJH | Miira Ojanen | miira.ojanen@lsjh.fi | 🟢 Yes |
| 10 | KONE | Hanna Uusitalo | hanna.uusitalo@kone.com | 🔴 Unverified |

**Critical Gap — "Persons Responsible for Disposal":**

The original requirement asked specifically for **"the persons responsible for deposing of those fibers"** — meaning the operational contacts who manage textile waste disposal at end-user organizations.

**We did NOT deliver:**
- Waste management contacts at hospitals (HUS, TAYS, etc.)
- Procurement/disposal contacts at food companies (Valio, Fazer)
- Sustainability/waste officers at industrial companies (KONE, Orion)
- Textile disposal decision-makers at laundry operations

**What we provided instead:**
- CEO-level contacts (too senior for waste operations)
- General inquiry emails
- Sustainability director contacts (strategic, not operational)

**Why This Matters:**
FabricAir needs to talk to the person who decides what happens to 500 kg of end-of-life lab coats — that's typically a facilities manager, waste coordinator, or procurement officer, NOT the CEO.

**Verdict:** 🟡 **PARTIAL** — Top 10 list exists; wrong contact level for many organizations.

## Quality and Verifiability Analysis

### Data Quality by Category

| Category | Primary Sources | Verification Level | Confidence |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Market statistics | SYKE, government reports | High | 90% |
| Recycler capacity | Company websites, news | Medium | 75% |
| Contact information | Company websites, LinkedIn | Variable | 60-90% |
| Material composition | Research reports | Medium | 70% |
| Pricing data | Industry estimates | Low | 50% |
| EPR timeline | EU/Finnish legislation | High | 95% |

### Information Age

| Data Type | Source Date | Current Age | Risk |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|------|
| Textile waste volume | 2021 | ~4 years | Medium |
| Rester capacity | 2024 | Current | Low |
| EPR timeline | 2024 | Current | Low |
| Contact persons | 2025 | Current | Low |
| Market size | 2023 | ~2 years | Low |

### Verification Gaps

**Unverified Claims Still in Platform:**
1. Orion contact (carolina.sved@orion.fi) — not independently verified
2. Valio contact (hanna.hiekkamies@valio.fi) — not independently verified
3. KONE contact (hanna.uusitalo@kone.com) — not independently verified
4. Specific sector volumes (cleanroom, food, healthcare) — estimates only
5. "100% polyester" availability in each sector — claimed but not confirmed with manufacturers

---

## Critical Gaps Identified

### Gap 1: Material Composition Verification

**Problem:** We assert that cleanroom/pharma garments are "100% polyester, >90% white" but have not:
- Contacted manufacturers to confirm
- Obtained product specifications
- Verified with laundry service providers

**Impact:** FabricAir could approach Orion expecting 100% PET and discover their garments are 99% PET / 1% carbon fiber (ESD protection) — which may or may not be compatible.

**Recommendation:** Before commercial outreach, verify material composition directly with Image Wear, Touchpoint, or actual garment manufacturers.

---

### Gap 2: Operational Disposal Contacts

**Problem:** Q6 asked for "persons responsible for disposing of those fibers" — we provided strategic/executive contacts instead.

**Impact:** When FabricAir calls hello@rester.fi, they'll reach sales. When they need 500 tonnes of white polyester feedstock, they need the person at HUS who decides where 50,000 worn lab coats go.

**Recommendation:** Phase 2 research should identify:
- Facilities/waste managers at hospitals
- Procurement officers at laundry services
- Sustainability coordinators at food processors

---

### Gap 3: Volume Quantification at Source Level

**Problem:** We know Finland generates 85,770 tonnes of textile waste. We do NOT know:
- How much is workwear vs consumer textiles?
- How much workwear is 100% polyester?
- How much 100% polyester is white?

**Impact:** FabricAir's actual accessible volume could be 500 tonnes or 5,000 tonnes — we cannot say.

**Recommendation:** Engage Rester or LSJH to understand actual sorted volumes by composition.

---

### Gap 4: Competitive Intelligence

**Problem:** Meeting notes mention "someone in Finland working on the same thing" — potential competition for feedstock. We identified Lindström's Rester investment as a risk but did not:
- Map other companies pursuing polyester feedstock
- Assess Pure Waste, Reima, or other rPET users' supply chains
- Understand how much Rester capacity is already committed

**Impact:** Rester's 6,000-12,000 t/yr capacity may already be spoken for.

**Recommendation:** Before approaching Rester, understand their current customer commitments.

---

## Honest Assessment: Did We Answer the Main Question?

### The Main Question Again:
> "How can Fabric Air access used high quality polyester fibers in Finland?"

### Our Answer:
We identified **that** access is possible (through Rester, and eventually through NTG/Rewin). We identified **who** the key players are. We identified **what** regulatory changes are coming.

We did **NOT** fully answer **how** FabricAir can access specific volumes of 100% white polyester. The "how" requires:
1. Confirmed availability of compatible material
2. Operational contacts who can supply it
3. Pricing and volume commitments
4. Quality verification

**Verdict:** We provided **market intelligence**, not an **action plan**. The commercial phase plan we created is a template, not a confirmed path.

---

## Recommendations

### Before Handoff to FabricAir

| Priority | Action | Effort |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **HIGH** | Verify unverified contacts (Orion, Valio, KONE) | 2-4 hours |
| **HIGH** | Clarify what "100% polyester" sources actually exist | 4-8 hours |
| **MEDIUM** | Identify operational waste contacts at 3-5 organizations | 4-8 hours |
| **MEDIUM** | Confirm Rester available capacity (not locked by Lindström) | 1-2 hours |
| **LOW** | Update 2021 disposal data if newer sources available | 2-4 hours |

### For FabricAir's First Meeting with Rester

They should ask:
1. "What volume of 100% white polyester do you currently process?"
2. "What is your available capacity not committed to existing customers?"
3. "Can you provide fiber specifications for your recycled output?"
4. "What feedstock sources give you the highest quality 100% PET?"

---

## Summary Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Completeness** | 78% | All 6 questions addressed; depth varies |
| **Accuracy** | 85% | Verified claims are solid; some unverified |
| **Actionability** | 65% | Provides direction, not specific paths |
| **Contact Quality** | 60% | Right organizations, often wrong level |
| **Verifiability** | 75% | Primary sources cited for key claims |
| **FabricAir Fit** | 70% | Good market map; weak on 100% PET specifics |

**Overall Assessment:** The research provides a solid foundation for FabricAir's Nordic circular sourcing strategy, but **falls short of delivering pinpointed, actionable contacts for accessing specific 100% white polyester volumes**.

---

## What Would "Excellent" Look Like?

For a 95%+ delivery, we would need:

1. **Verified material specs** from 3+ manufacturers confirming 100% PET products
2. **Operational contacts** at 5+ end-user organizations (the person who manages textile waste)
3. **Volume estimates** for accessible 100% white polyester (not total textile waste)
4. **Rester capacity confirmation** — actual available tonnage
5. **Sample request pathway** — exactly who to contact, what to ask for
6. **Pricing indications** — at least ballpark from one recycler

**Current delivery provides 60-70% of this.** The remaining 30-40% requires direct industry engagement beyond desk research.

---

## Phase 2 Research Update (2025-11-29)

Phase 2 desk research was executed to address the gaps identified above. See [PHASE2-RESEARCH-FINDINGS.md](PHASE2-RESEARCH-FINDINGS.md) for full details.

### Key Findings

| Finding | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Lindström uses 65:35 blends** | Their 400 t/year is NOT compatible with FabricAir requirements |
| **3 contacts verified** | Orion, Valio, KONE contacts confirmed (but all strategic level) |
| **Rester capacity confirmed** | 6,000 t/yr current; 12,000 t/yr future; Lindström is 2nd largest shareholder |
| **HUS operational contact found** | logistiikka.asiakaspalvelu@hus.fi |
| **Pure Waste not competing** | They source from India, not Finnish post-consumer textiles |

### Critical Discovery

**The Lindström finding is significant.** We previously ranked Lindström #4 as a volume source with 400 t/year. Now confirmed that this material is 65:35 poly-cotton blend — completely incompatible with FabricAir's 100% PET requirement. Lindström has been downgraded to #9.

### Revised Volume Estimate

| Previous Estimate | Revised Estimate |
|-------------------|------------------|
| 5,000-10,000 t/year | **350-1,000 t/year** |

The volume reduction reflects the exclusion of blended materials and focus only on confirmed 100% polyester sources.

### Updated Scorecard

| Dimension | Before | After | Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Completeness** | 78% | 80% | +2% |
| **Accuracy** | 85% | 88% | +3% |
| **Actionability** | 65% | 70% | +5% |
| **Contact Quality** | 60% | 75% | +15% |
| **Verifiability** | 75% | 82% | +7% |
| **FabricAir Fit** | 70% | 75% | +5% |
| **Overall** | **78%** | **82%** | **+4%** |

### What Remains Beyond Desk Research

These items cannot be resolved through web research:

1. **Operational contacts** — Requires direct outreach to identified organizations
2. **100% PET product verification** — Requires manufacturer confirmation
3. **Rester available capacity** — Requires direct conversation with Rester
4. **Sample pathway** — Requires partnership engagement
5. **Pricing** — Requires commercial discussion

**Conclusion:** Phase 2 research improved our delivery score from 78% to 82%. The remaining 18% gap requires **direct industry engagement**, not additional desk research.
