# Qualitative Delivery Assessment

**Assessment Date:** 2025-11-29
**Purpose:** Honest, reconciled evaluation of project delivery quality
**Status:** Final Assessment

---

## Assessment Discrepancy

Two previous assessments exist with conflicting scores:

| Document | Score | Perspective |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| DELIVERY-ASSESSMENT.md | 92% | Optimistic — focuses on breadth |
| CRITICAL-ASSESSMENT.md | 82% | Honest — focuses on FabricAir's actual needs |

**This document reconciles these assessments and provides a final qualitative evaluation.**

## Original Requirements (Verbatim)

From the NCC Segment Analysis brief:

> **Main Question:** How can Fabric Air access used high quality polyester fibers in Finland to realise its ambitions to develop 100% circular polyester sourcing for its ventilation system?

### The Six Sub-Questions

| # | Question | Key Deliverable |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| Q1 | What sectors/actors use high-quality polyester (durable uniforms, workwear, preferably white)? | Sector list with actors |
| Q2 | Who are main stakeholders in production, use, reuse? | Stakeholder map |
| Q3 | How are textiles disposed today? What are reuse levels? | Disposal analysis |
| Q4 | What regulations govern disposal/reuse? How will they evolve? | Regulatory timeline |
| Q5 | What public/private initiatives exist? Status, ambition, contacts? | Initiative list |
| Q6 | **Top 10 sources with persons responsible for disposing** | Contact list |

### Material Requirements

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Material | **100% Polyester** (mono-material) |
| Quality | High durability, suitable for weaving |
| Weight | ~300 g/m² |
| Color | **White preferred** |
| NOT suitable | Polyester/cotton blends (65/35) |

---

## Honest Question-by-Question Assessment

### Q1: Sectors and Actors — PARTIAL (70%)

**What was required:**
- Identify sectors using high-quality polyester
- Focus on durable uniforms/workwear
- White color preference

**What we delivered:**
- Identified 4 priority sectors (cleanroom, food, healthcare, industrial)
- Sector-by-sector white percentage estimates
- Named key companies per sector

**Critical Gap:**
We did NOT verify which specific products are 100% polyester vs blends. The Lindström finding (65:35 blend) revealed this assumption was wrong.

**Qualitative Assessment:** Good sector mapping, but material verification is weak. FabricAir cannot act on this information without further verification.

---

### Q2: Stakeholders — DELIVERED (90%)

**What was required:**
- Map production, use, reuse stakeholders

**What we delivered:**
- Comprehensive value chain documentation
- 200+ companies identified
- Key partnerships mapped (Touchpoint→Rester, Lindström→Rester)

**Qualitative Assessment:** Strong delivery. FabricAir has a clear picture of who controls what in the ecosystem.

---

### Q3: Disposal and Reuse — DELIVERED (88%)

**What was required:**
- Current disposal routes
- Reuse levels

**What we delivered:**
- 60/22/18% breakdown (incineration/material recovery/export)
- <1% fiber-to-fiber recycling
- 85,770 tonnes/year total volume
- SYKE 2021 primary source

**Limitation:**
Data is 4 years old. Workwear not separated from consumer textiles.

**Qualitative Assessment:** Solid macro-level data with verified sources. FabricAir understands the current landscape.

---

### Q4: Regulations — DELIVERED (95%)

**What was required:**
- Current regulations
- Expected evolution

**What we delivered:**
- Complete timeline (2016 landfill ban → 2028 EPR)
- Finland 2 years ahead of EU
- Digital Product Passport timeline
- Primary sources cited

**Qualitative Assessment:** Excellent delivery. This is the strongest section with clear, actionable regulatory intelligence.

---

### Q5: Initiatives — DELIVERED (85%)

**What was required:**
- List public/private initiatives
- Status and ambition
- Contact points

**What we delivered:**
- 10+ initiatives mapped
- Operational status for each
- Critical discovery: LSJH Turku plant cancelled (April 2024)
- Verified contacts for major initiatives

**Qualitative Assessment:** Strong delivery with important critical discovery (LSJH cancellation changes the landscape).

---

### Q6: Top 10 Sources with Disposal Contacts — PARTIAL (55%)

**What was required:**
> "Make a list of the (10) most promising stakeholders... **including the persons responsible for deposing of those fibers**"

**What we delivered:**

| Rank | Organization | Contact Type | What We Have |
|------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | Rester | Recycler | General email (hello@rester.fi) |
| 2 | Puro | Aggregator | CEO contact |
| 3 | Touchpoint | Aggregator | CEO contact |
| 4 | Orion | End-user | Strategic contact (verified) |
| 5 | Image Wear | Manufacturer | CEO contact |
| 6 | Valio | End-user | Strategic contact (verified) |
| 7 | SOL Group | Aggregator | Unverified |
| 8 | KONE | End-user | Strategic contact (verified) |
| 9 | Lindström | ⚠️ INCOMPATIBLE | 65:35 blend |
| 10 | LSJH | Coordination | Verified |

**Critical Gap:**
The requirement asked for **"persons responsible for deposing of those fibers"** — meaning operational contacts (facilities managers, waste coordinators).

**We provided:**
- CEO/executive contacts (too senior)
- Strategic/sustainability directors (wrong level)
- General inquiry emails (not decision-makers)

**Only 1 operational contact found:** HUS Logistics (logistiikka.asiakaspalvelu@hus.fi)

**Qualitative Assessment:** We identified the right organizations but provided the wrong level of contacts. FabricAir needs to reach operational decision-makers, not CEOs.

---

## Critical Findings from Phase 2 Research

### Finding 1: Lindström Material Incompatibility

| Previous Assumption | Reality |
|---------------------|---------|
| Lindström = 400 t/year of recyclable material | Material is 65:35 poly-cotton blend |
| Lindström ranked #4 | Downgraded to #9 (incompatible) |
| Volume estimate 5-10k t/year | Revised to 350-1,000 t/year |

**Impact:** This single finding reduced accessible volume by 80-90%.

### Finding 2: Rester Capacity Lock Risk

| Factor | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Lindström role | 2nd largest Rester shareholder AND customer |
| Capacity commitment | Likely has priority access |
| Available capacity | Unknown — requires direct inquiry |

**Impact:** Even if FabricAir finds suitable feedstock, Rester capacity may be committed.

### Finding 3: Contact Level Mismatch

| What we provided | What was needed |
|------------------|-----------------|
| CEO-level contacts | Facilities managers |
| Sustainability directors | Waste coordinators |
| General inquiry emails | Procurement officers |

**Impact:** FabricAir cannot directly reach decision-makers for textile disposal.

| Q6 | 25% | 50% | 12.5% |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | | **75.5%** |

---

## Qualitative Delivery Status

### Overall Grade: C+ (75.5%)

**Translation:**
- **Market Intelligence:** Strong (A-)
- **Actionable Contacts:** Weak (D+)
- **Material Specificity:** Weak (D)
- **Regulatory Clarity:** Excellent (A)
- **Strategic Direction:** Good (B+)

### What We Did Well

1. **Comprehensive market mapping** — FabricAir understands the Nordic landscape
2. **Regulatory intelligence** — Clear timeline for EPR and policy changes
3. **Critical discoveries** — LSJH cancellation, Lindström blend issue
4. **Value chain understanding** — Who owns what, who controls access
5. **Nordic expansion** — Went beyond Finland to include Sweden and Norway

### What We Did Poorly

1. **Contact level mismatch** — CEOs instead of operational contacts
2. **Material verification** — Assumed 100% polyester without confirmation
3. **Volume estimation** — Original estimates were 10x too high
4. **Actionable pathways** — Provided market map, not action plan
5. **Rester capacity** — Did not confirm available (uncommitted) capacity

---

## FabricAir Fit Assessment

### Can FabricAir Act on This Information?

| Action | Ready? | Gap |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Contact recyclers | Partial | Have general emails, not technical contacts |
| Source 100% polyester | No | Cannot confirm which sources have compatible material |
| Estimate accessible volume | No | Range is 350-1,000 t (too wide) |
| Understand regulations | Yes | Clear timeline provided |
| Identify partners | Partial | Right organizations, wrong contacts |

### What FabricAir Still Needs

1. **Confirmed 100% polyester sources** with material specifications
2. **Operational contacts** at end-user organizations
3. **Rester available capacity** (not committed to Lindström/others)
4. **Sample pathway** — who to contact for material samples
5. **Pricing indication** — at least ballpark from one recycler

---

## Honest Summary

### The Main Question Was:
> "How can Fabric Air access used high quality polyester fibers in Finland?"

### Our Answer:
We identified **that** access is theoretically possible (through Rester, cleanroom sector). We identified **who** the key players are. We identified **what** regulatory changes are coming.

We did **NOT** answer **how** FabricAir can access specific volumes of 100% white polyester. The "how" requires:
1. Confirmed availability of compatible material ❌
2. Operational contacts who can supply it ❌
3. Pricing and volume commitments ❌
4. Quality verification ❌

### Verdict

**We provided market intelligence, not an action plan.**

The research gives FabricAir a strong foundation to begin commercial discussions, but they cannot proceed without:
- Verifying material composition directly with manufacturers
- Identifying operational disposal contacts at end-user organizations
- Confirming Rester's available (uncommitted) capacity
- Requesting samples for quality testing

---

## Comparison of Assessments

| Assessment | Score | Bias |
|------------|-------|------|
| DELIVERY-ASSESSMENT.md | 92% | Optimistic — counts breadth over depth |
| CRITICAL-ASSESSMENT.md (Phase 2) | 82% | Honest but still generous |
| **This Assessment** | **75.5%** | Strict — weighted by FabricAir's actual needs |

### Why the Difference?

1. **Q6 is weighted 25%** — This is the most critical deliverable for FabricAir
2. **Contact level matters** — CEOs can't make disposal decisions
3. **Material verification is essential** — Lindström finding proved assumptions wrong
4. **Volume estimates were inflated** — Reduced by 80-90%

---

## Recommendations for Completion

### To Reach 85%+ Delivery

| Action | Priority | Effort | Score Impact |
|--------|----------|--------|--------------|
| Identify 3+ operational contacts (facilities/waste) | HIGH | 4-8 hrs | +5% |
| Confirm 2+ 100% polyester product sources | HIGH | 4-8 hrs | +3% |
| Confirm Rester available capacity | HIGH | 2-4 hrs | +2% |
| Update volume estimates with sector breakdown | MEDIUM | 2-4 hrs | +2% |

### To Reach 95%+ Delivery (Requires Industry Engagement)

1. Direct outreach to identified organizations
2. Sample requests and material testing
3. Commercial discussions with recyclers
4. Facility visits to verify operations

**Note:** Desk research cannot achieve 95%+ delivery. The remaining gap requires direct industry engagement.

---

## Final Assessment

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| **Quantitative Delivery** | 75.5% |
| **Qualitative Grade** | C+ |
| **FabricAir Readiness** | Partial |
| **Desk Research Ceiling** | ~85% |

**Conclusion:** The project delivered solid market intelligence but falls short on actionable contacts and material verification. FabricAir has a map of the landscape but not a clear path to their destination.
