## Critical Findings (Phase 2)

| Finding | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Lindström uses 65:35 blends** | 400 t/year volume INCOMPATIBLE |
| **Volume estimate revised** | 5-10k → 350-1,000 t/year |
| **Contact level mismatch** | CEOs provided, operational contacts needed |
| **Rester capacity risk** | Lindström is 2nd largest shareholder |

## Deliverables vs. Requirements

### Original NCC Mission

> "Kartlegge selskaper i Finland, Sverige og Norge som spesialiserer seg på innsamling av brukte polyesterfibre for resirkulering..."

| Requirement | Status | Score |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Finland mapping | Complete | 80% |
| Sweden mapping | Complete | 85% |
| Norway mapping | Complete | 80% |
| 100% polyester sources | **Partial** | 55% |
| Operational contacts | **Weak** | 50% |
| Volume quantification | **Revised down** | 60% |

## Question-by-Question Delivery

| Question | Weight | Score | Status |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Q1: Sectors & Actors | 15% | 65% | Material verification gap |
| Q2: Stakeholders | 15% | 90% | Strong delivery |
| Q3: Disposal & Reuse | 15% | 85% | Data is 4 years old |
| Q4: Regulations | 15% | 95% | Excellent |
| Q5: Initiatives | 15% | 85% | LSJH cancellation discovered |
| Q6: Top 10 + Contacts | **25%** | **50%** | Wrong contact level |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | **75.5%** | |

## What We Delivered Well

| Area | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| Market mapping | Comprehensive 3-country analysis |
| Regulatory timeline | Clear EPR and policy roadmap |
| Critical discoveries | LSJH cancelled, Lindström blends, Rester capacity |
| Value chain | Complete stakeholder ecosystem |
| Nordic expansion | Beyond original Finland scope |

## What We Delivered Poorly

| Area | Gap |
|------|-----|
| Contact level | CEOs/executives instead of operational contacts |
| Material verification | Assumed 100% PET without confirmation |
| Volume estimates | Initial estimates 10x too high |
| Actionable pathways | Market map, not action plan |
| Rester capacity | Unknown available (uncommitted) capacity |

---

## Qualitative Grade

| Dimension | Phase 2 | Phase 2.1 |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Market Intelligence | A- | **A** |
| Regulatory Clarity | A | A |
| Citation Quality | D | **B+** |
| Actionable Contacts | D+ | **C+** |
| Material Specificity | D | C |
| Strategic Direction | B+ | A- |
| **Overall** | C+ | **B-** |

---

## FabricAir Readiness

| Action | Ready? | Gap |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Contact recyclers | Partial | General emails only |
| Source 100% polyester | No | No confirmed sources |
| Estimate volume | No | Range too wide (350-1,000 t) |
| Understand regulations | Yes | Clear timeline |
| Identify partners | Partial | Right orgs, wrong contacts |

---

## Path to Improved Delivery

### To Reach 85%

| Action | Priority | Score Impact |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Identify 3+ operational contacts | HIGH | +5% |
| Confirm 2+ 100% PET sources | HIGH | +3% |
| Confirm Rester available capacity | HIGH | +2% |
| Update volume estimates | MEDIUM | +2% |

### Desk Research Ceiling Reached: 80%

The remaining gap (20%) requires direct industry engagement:
- Sample requests and material testing
- Commercial discussions with recyclers
- Operational contact identification through direct outreach
- Pricing and volume negotiations

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 2.1 transformed market intelligence into cited, verifiable research.**

With 25+ sources documented and 3 operational contacts identified, FabricAir now has:

1. ✅ Fully cited market data with verification URLs
2. ✅ Refined volume estimates with calculation methodology
3. ✅ Operational contacts at HUS, Puro, and Valio partner
4. ⚠️ Still needed: Rester capacity confirmation, pricing terms

**Next steps require direct industry engagement, not further desk research.**
