# Rester Oy: Processing Capacity and Market Position

**Rester Oy** is a Finnish textile recycling company that operates the first large\-scale end\-of\-life textile refinement plant in the Nordic countries[touchpointww\.com](https://www.touchpointww.com/news/nordic-countries-first-large-scale-end-of-life-textile-refinement-plant-to-open-in-paimio-in-2021#:~:text=Image)\. Since beginning operations in late 2021, Rester has become a pioneer in mechanical textile recycling, with a significant processing capacity and a strong market position in Finland and Northern Europe\. Below, we verify Rester’s confirmed processing capacity, describe its Paimio facility and operations, and assess its competitive standing in the industry\.

## Processing Capacity

Rester’s mechanical recycling plant in Paimio, Finland, currently handles about **6,000 tonnes of textile waste per year** on its own production line[arkisto\.sitra\.fi](https://arkisto.sitra.fi/en/cases/rester-is-finlands-first-large-scale-textile-recycling-plant-we-want-to-revolutionise-the-raw-materials-of-textiles-in-industry/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20our%20recycling%20plant%20in,textile%20waste%20generated%20in%20Finland)\. This line processes end\-of\-life textiles from businesses \(e\.g\. workwear, linens, and cutting scraps\)\. In addition, the same facility has a parallel line operated in partnership with the municipal waste firm **LSJH** to treat household textile waste\. **Combined, the Paimio plant can process roughly 12,000 tonnes of textiles annually**, which equates to about *10% of Finland’s annual textile waste*[yle\.fi](https://yle.fi/a/3-12172022#:~:text=Tuesday%20and%20aims%20to%20begin,solving%20that%20problem)\. This capacity figure \(approximately 12 million kilograms per year\) has been consistent since the plant’s launch, and was part of Rester’s goal to significantly boost Finland’s textile recycling rate[yle\.fi](https://yle.fi/a/3-12172022#:~:text=Tuesday%20and%20aims%20to%20begin,solving%20that%20problem)\.

 

In mid\-2023, Rester **expanded its capacity** by acquiring LSJH’s pilot recycling line\. This deal means that starting 2024, Rester will operate **both processing lines** at the Paimio facility, effectively doubling the company’s in\-house throughput potential[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/news/rester-oy-buys-lsjhs-pilot-line-for-end-of-life-textile-fibre-opening/#:~:text=With%20the%20new%20agreement%2C%20LSJH%E2%80%99s,both%20processing%20lines%20in%20Paimio)\. Rester’s CEO Outi Luukko noted that adding a second fiber\-opening line was a strategic move enabling the company to meet the near\-future demand for recycled textile fiber in the Nordics[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/news/rester-oy-buys-lsjhs-pilot-line-for-end-of-life-textile-fibre-opening/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20acquisition%20of%20the%20second,Rester%20Oy%E2%80%99s%20CEO%20Outi%20Luukko)[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/news/rester-oy-buys-lsjhs-pilot-line-for-end-of-life-textile-fibre-opening/#:~:text=With%20the%20new%20agreement%2C%20LSJH%E2%80%99s,both%20processing%20lines%20in%20Paimio)\. With EU regulations making separate textile waste collection mandatory by 2025, Rester’s ~12,000\-tonne capacity positions it well to handle the growing volumes of recyclable textiles\. In fact, Rester had anticipated scaling up – at launch it was stated that the plant could **double its volume in the future** as demand increases[apparelviews\.com](https://www.apparelviews.com/finland-offers-new-revolution-to-textile-industry-challenges/#:~:text=process%20post,future%20to%20double%20the%20capacity)\. The *11,000–12,000 tonne per year* figure for total output has been cited by investors as the full capacity of the Paimio site \(Rester’s own 6,000 tonnes plus the household textile line\)[tesi\.fi](https://tesi.fi/en/article/rester-article/#:~:text=industry%20from%20all%20the%20types,%E2%80%9D)\. This makes Rester one of the largest single\-site textile recyclers by capacity in Northern Europe\.

## Facility and Operations

Rester’s facility is located in **Paimio**, in southwest Finland, and was completed in 2021\. The plant is about **3,000 square meters** in size[euratex\.eu](https://euratex.eu/stories/rester-ltd-creates-a-new-life-for-textile-fibres/#:~:text=In%20the%20summer%20of%202021%2C%C2%A0Rester,waste%20as%20industrial%20raw%20material) and was developed as a joint effort between Rester Oy \(focused on corporate textile waste\) and Lounais\-Suomen Jätehuolto \(LSJH, the regional waste management company handling consumer textiles\)[touchpointww\.com](https://www.touchpointww.com/news/nordic-countries-first-large-scale-end-of-life-textile-refinement-plant-to-open-in-paimio-in-2021#:~:text=recycles%20companies%27%20end,of%20Finland%E2%80%99s%20textile%20waste)\. The two **production lines** in the facility mirror this division: one line processes *post\-industrial and corporate textiles* supplied by companies, while the other \(initially run by LSJH\) processes *post\-consumer textiles* collected from households[touchpointww\.com](https://www.touchpointww.com/news/nordic-countries-first-large-scale-end-of-life-textile-refinement-plant-to-open-in-paimio-in-2021#:~:text=recycles%20companies%27%20end,of%20Finland%E2%80%99s%20textile%20waste)[arkisto\.sitra\.fi](https://arkisto.sitra.fi/en/cases/rester-is-finlands-first-large-scale-textile-recycling-plant-we-want-to-revolutionise-the-raw-materials-of-textiles-in-industry/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20our%20recycling%20plant%20in,textile%20waste%20generated%20in%20Finland)\. Both lines use a **mechanical recycling process** to convert sorted end\-of\-life textiles into fiber\. In this process, textiles are **shredded and opened back into fiber form** after removal of non\-textile components \(such as buttons and zippers\)\. The output is a fluffy recycled fiber that can serve as a raw material for new products\.

 

*Recycled textile fibers produced by Rester’s mechanical recycling process\. These high\-quality fibers can replace virgin materials in various applications\. Rester’s recovered fiber can be used in the textile industry to spin new yarns and fabrics, as well as in technical and nonwoven products like insulation, acoustic panels, filter materials, and composites[tesi\.fi](https://tesi.fi/en/news-item/rester-growth-funding/#:~:text=secured%20EUR%20six%20million%20in,composite%20materials%20and%20acoustic%20panels)\. This closed\-loop approach gives new life to cotton, polyester and other fibers that would otherwise be incinerated or landfilled\.*

 

The **end products** of Rester’s recycling illustrate the facility’s role in a circular economy\. The recycled fiber coming out of Paimio is used by a range of industries: for example, it can be spun into yarn for new textiles, or used in **nonwovens** for applications such as building insulation, sound\-absorbing acoustic panels, technical felts, geo\-textiles, and even composite materials[touchpointww\.com](https://www.touchpointww.com/news/nordic-countries-first-large-scale-end-of-life-textile-refinement-plant-to-open-in-paimio-in-2021#:~:text=The%20future%20plant%20will%20be,textiles)[texintel\.com](https://www.texintel.com/eco-news/marimekko-works-with-rester-oy-of-finland-to-recycle-end-of-life-textiles-from-its-own-production#:~:text=In%20Rester%E2%80%99s%20mechanical%20recycling%20process,textiles%20are%20opened%20into%20fibers)\. Both the corporate and household textile streams at Rester’s plant produce similar fiber suitable for these uses\. By creating marketable fiber from waste, Rester enables other manufacturers to replace virgin cotton or polyester with recycled content, reducing environmental impact\.

 

**Input supply and partnerships:** Rester’s operations are fed by both industrial partners and municipal collection\. On the business side, Rester has secured partnerships to recycle textile waste from major companies\. For instance, the Finnish workwear service company **Lindström Oy** sends about *500 tonnes per year* of used workwear, uniforms, mats and other textiles to Rester for recycling[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-and-rester-launch-the-first-industrial-scale-textile-waste-refining-business-in-the-nordics/#:~:text=start%20processing%20Lindstr%C3%B6m%E2%80%99s%20workwear%20clothes%2C,waste%20textiles%20globally%20by%202025)\. This partnership, started in early 2021, allows Lindström to move closer to its goal of 100% recycling of its textile waste by 2025 while providing Rester a steady volume of material[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-and-rester-launch-the-first-industrial-scale-textile-waste-refining-business-in-the-nordics/#:~:text=start%20processing%20Lindstr%C3%B6m%E2%80%99s%20workwear%20clothes%2C,waste%20textiles%20globally%20by%202025)\. Another example is **Marimekko**, a Finnish fashion and textile brand, which began collaborating with Rester in 2022 to recycle the **end\-of\-life fabric offcuts and misprinted textiles** from Marimekko’s printing factory and sewing shop[texintel\.com](https://www.texintel.com/eco-news/marimekko-works-with-rester-oy-of-finland-to-recycle-end-of-life-textiles-from-its-own-production#:~:text=Marimekko%20have%20started%20to%20cooperate,life%20textiles)\. Through this cooperation, Marimekko’s production scraps in Helsinki are sent to Paimio, where Rester turns them into new fiber that Marimekko can potentially use in future products[texintel\.com](https://www.texintel.com/eco-news/marimekko-works-with-rester-oy-of-finland-to-recycle-end-of-life-textiles-from-its-own-production#:~:text=Marimekko%20have%20started%20to%20cooperate,life%20textiles)\. These partnerships demonstrate how Rester’s facility integrates into corporate sustainability initiatives, offering a recycling solution for textile waste streams that previously went to incineration\.

 

It’s worth noting that while Rester handles the **mechanical fiber processing**, LSJH has been responsible for **collecting and pre\-sorting** household textiles across Finland\. LSJH developed optical sorting technology to classify textiles by material type \(cotton, polyester, etc\.\) before they are recycled, ensuring higher quality output[touchpointww\.com](https://www.touchpointww.com/news/nordic-countries-first-large-scale-end-of-life-textile-refinement-plant-to-open-in-paimio-in-2021#:~:text=LSJH%20has%20launched%20a%20pilot,and%20the%20resulting%20fibre%20products)\. Initially, LSJH operated the household textile line at Paimio as a pilot and sent its sorted consumer textiles there\. After Rester’s acquisition of that line in 2023, LSJH continues to collect and sort textile waste nationwide \(and is planning a larger textile refinement plant in Turku\), while Rester now performs the fiberizing of both **business and consumer textiles under one roof**[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/news/rester-oy-buys-lsjhs-pilot-line-for-end-of-life-textile-fibre-opening/#:~:text=Lounais,its%20growing%20fibre%20opening%20business)[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/news/rester-oy-buys-lsjhs-pilot-line-for-end-of-life-textile-fibre-opening/#:~:text=With%20the%20new%20agreement%2C%20LSJH%E2%80%99s,both%20processing%20lines%20in%20Paimio)\. This setup has effectively created a **textile recycling hub in Paimio** – sometimes referred to as a circular economy cluster – where multiple stakeholders \(private companies and a public waste utility\) collaborate to close the loop for textiles[touchpointww\.com](https://www.touchpointww.com/news/nordic-countries-first-large-scale-end-of-life-textile-refinement-plant-to-open-in-paimio-in-2021#:~:text=Rester%E2%80%99s%20initiative%20aims%20to%20create,circular%20economy%20companies%20in%20Paimio)\.

## Market Position and Industry Standing

**National and regional leadership:** Rester Oy has quickly attained a leading position in textile recycling, both in Finland and in the broader Nordic region\. It is **Finland’s first** industrial\-scale textile recycling plant and the **largest of its kind in the Nordic countries**[touchpointww\.com](https://www.touchpointww.com/news/nordic-countries-first-large-scale-end-of-life-textile-refinement-plant-to-open-in-paimio-in-2021#:~:text=Image)[texintel\.com](https://www.texintel.com/eco-news/marimekko-works-with-rester-oy-of-finland-to-recycle-end-of-life-textiles-from-its-own-production#:~:text=materials)\. When the Paimio facility opened in 2021, it was reported as the **Nordics’ biggest textile recycling centre**, capable of turning waste clothing into new fiber on a scale not seen before in the region[yle\.fi](https://yle.fi/a/3-12172022#:~:text=The%20facility%20has%20a%20capacity,the%20country%27s%20cloth%20material%20waste)[yle\.fi](https://yle.fi/a/3-12172022#:~:text=The%20new%20facility%2C%20which%20is,fibres%20on%20a%20large%20scale)\. In practical terms, Rester alone can handle around 10% of all textile waste in Finland, a significant share for a single facility[yle\.fi](https://yle.fi/a/3-12172022#:~:text=Tuesday%20and%20aims%20to%20begin,solving%20that%20problem)\. This prominent capacity, combined with the lack of similar facilities elsewhere in Northern Europe, gives Rester a strong competitive advantage\. In fact, as of 2023 **no other plant in Northern Europe offers the same services at an industrial scale**, which is why Rester has been sourcing textiles from outside Finland as well[tesi\.fi](https://tesi.fi/en/article/rester-article/#:~:text=Rester%E2%80%99s%20internationalisation%20is%20already%20on,which%20receives%20textiles%20for%20recycling)\. Rester is frequently cited as the **largest full\-scale mechanical textile recycler in Northern Europe** by capacity \(approximately 6,000 tonnes on its own line\)[textended\.eu](https://textended.eu/rester/#:~:text=Rester%20is%20a%20full,new%20one%20coming%20to%20Poland)\. The company’s head start in establishing a functioning recycling value chain means it faces little direct competition within Finland today – though efforts are underway to replicate similar plants in the coming years, Rester enjoys a *pioneering status*\.

 

**Industry recognition:** Due to its trailblazing role, Rester has garnered both public and private support that bolsters its market position\. The company was highlighted by Finland’s innovation fund Sitra as one of the “most interesting companies” in the circular economy, noting Rester’s potential to revolutionize textile raw materials for industry[arkisto\.sitra\.fi](https://arkisto.sitra.fi/en/cases/rester-is-finlands-first-large-scale-textile-recycling-plant-we-want-to-revolutionise-the-raw-materials-of-textiles-in-industry/#:~:text=Rester%20makes%20high,industry%20with%20recycled%20raw%20materials)[arkisto\.sitra\.fi](https://arkisto.sitra.fi/en/cases/rester-is-finlands-first-large-scale-textile-recycling-plant-we-want-to-revolutionise-the-raw-materials-of-textiles-in-industry/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20our%20recycling%20plant%20in,textile%20waste%20generated%20in%20Finland)\. Rester’s approach – providing a **commercially viable solution** to recycle both corporate and household textiles into new raw materials – is seen as a model for the circular economy in textiles[yle\.fi](https://yle.fi/a/3-12172022#:~:text=The%20new%20facility%2C%20which%20is,fibres%20on%20a%20large%20scale)\. This has attracted investments from major players in the textile and finance sectors\. In 2022, Rester secured a €6 million growth funding round **led by Lindström Group**, one of its largest customers and a significant textile industry actor[tesi\.fi](https://tesi.fi/en/news-item/rester-growth-funding/#:~:text=The%20round%20was%20led%20by,initial%20investment%20in%20the%20company)\. Lindström’s investment made it a minority owner, aligning the interests of a major workwear supplier with Rester’s success\. The same funding round brought in **Tesi \(Finnish Industry Investment\)** – a government\-owned investment firm – under its circular economy program, as well as private investors like Besodos and Taaleri, all of whom saw promise in Rester’s business model[tesi\.fi](https://tesi.fi/en/news-item/rester-growth-funding/#:~:text=The%20round%20was%20led%20by,initial%20investment%20in%20the%20company)[tesi\.fi](https://tesi.fi/en/article/rester-article/#:~:text=Through%20its%20investment%20round%20in,as%20the%20company%E2%80%99s%20principal%20shareholder)\. By early 2025, Rester raised further capital \(€4\.9 million in a second round\) to accelerate growth, with both existing shareholders \(like Lindström and Tesi\) and new investors participating[siliconcanals\.com](https://siliconcanals.com/finnish-company-rester-oy-secures-4-9m/#:~:text=recently%20announced%20that%20it%20has,in%20its%20second%20funding%20round)[siliconcanals\.com](https://siliconcanals.com/finnish-company-rester-oy-secures-4-9m/#:~:text=The%20company%20raised%20funding%20from,as%20well%20as%20new%20investors)\. This strong investor backing underscores Rester’s credibility and leadership in the market\. It also provides resources for Rester to scale up and stay ahead of emerging competitors\.

 

**Competitive environment:** While Rester currently operates with little direct competition in Finland, the landscape is evolving as textile recycling gains priority\. The Finnish government and waste companies have indeed planned to establish **additional textile recycling plants** based on the Paimio model[yle\.fi](https://yle.fi/a/3-12172022#:~:text=for%20nearly%2010%20years%2C,said)\. For example, LSJH’s upcoming facility in Turku will eventually handle a large share of household textile waste nationally\. Nevertheless, Rester has positioned itself as the **key private\-sector recycler** and is likely to continue focusing on business \(B2B\) textile waste and international partnerships\. Its early mover advantage and operational know\-how make it a likely partner or stakeholder in any new initiatives\. Moreover, Rester’s model is being extended beyond Finland’s borders\. The company has opened a **service point in Sweden** to collect textiles, recognizing the lack of local recycling options in neighboring countries[tesi\.fi](https://tesi.fi/en/article/rester-article/#:~:text=Rester%E2%80%99s%20internationalisation%20is%20already%20on,which%20receives%20textiles%20for%20recycling)\. Rester is also exploring expansion into continental Europe – plans have been discussed to either build **new plants abroad or form joint ventures** with local players to replicate Rester’s recycling process in other markets[tesi\.fi](https://tesi.fi/en/article/rester-article/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20current,tailored%20to%20the%20target%20market)\. There are indications that Rester is considering markets like Poland and others in Europe for new facilities as textile waste volumes increase and regulations push for recycling[textended\.eu](https://textended.eu/rester/#:~:text=workwear%20companies,new%20one%20coming%20to%20Poland)[tesi\.fi](https://tesi.fi/en/article/rester-article/#:~:text=Luukko%20has%20a%20realistic%20understanding,venture%20with%20a%20local%20player)\. These expansion plans suggest that Rester aims to maintain its competitive edge by scaling up geographically, effectively becoming an **international textile recycling service provider** rather than just a single plant\.

 

In summary, **Rester Oy’s processing capacity** stands at about *6,000 tonnes per year \(industrial textiles alone\), or up to ~12,000 tonnes&#x2F;year including the household textiles line*[arkisto\.sitra\.fi](https://arkisto.sitra.fi/en/cases/rester-is-finlands-first-large-scale-textile-recycling-plant-we-want-to-revolutionise-the-raw-materials-of-textiles-in-industry/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20our%20recycling%20plant%20in,textile%20waste%20generated%20in%20Finland)[yle\.fi](https://yle.fi/a/3-12172022#:~:text=Tuesday%20and%20aims%20to%20begin,solving%20that%20problem)\. This makes Rester’s Paimio plant one of the largest textile recycling facilities in Northern Europe\. The **facility** itself is a 3,000 m² modern plant with two processing lines, converting both corporate and consumer textile waste into valuable fiber that can be reused in new products[euratex\.eu](https://euratex.eu/stories/rester-ltd-creates-a-new-life-for-textile-fibres/#:~:text=In%20the%20summer%20of%202021%2C%C2%A0Rester,waste%20as%20industrial%20raw%20material)[touchpointww\.com](https://www.touchpointww.com/news/nordic-countries-first-large-scale-end-of-life-textile-refinement-plant-to-open-in-paimio-in-2021#:~:text=The%20future%20plant%20will%20be,textiles)\. Through partnerships with waste management agencies and companies like Lindström and Marimekko, Rester secures a steady supply of raw material and demonstrates the viability of large\-scale textile circularity\. As for its **market position**, Rester is the **first mover in Finland and the Nordic region**, currently operating with no equal in scale in its niche[tesi\.fi](https://tesi.fi/en/article/rester-article/#:~:text=Rester%E2%80%99s%20internationalisation%20is%20already%20on,which%20receives%20textiles%20for%20recycling)\. It enjoys strong support from industry investors and is poised to grow alongside new EU recycling mandates\. Going forward, Rester’s challenge will be to maintain this lead as additional recycling capacity comes online in Finland and Europe – but for now, it is *widely regarded as a forerunner* in textile recycling, turning Finland into a hub for innovative fiber recovery[touchpointww\.com](https://www.touchpointww.com/news/nordic-countries-first-large-scale-end-of-life-textile-refinement-plant-to-open-in-paimio-in-2021#:~:text=From%20the%20perspective%20of%20Rester,a%20responsible%20work%20clothing%20collection)[tesi\.fi](https://tesi.fi/en/news-item/rester-growth-funding/#:~:text=Rester%20is%20a%20leading%20global,Founded%20in%202019%2C%20Rester%20began)\.
