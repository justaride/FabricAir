# Recycled Polyester Fiber Pricing in the European Market

## Market Price Indices and Recent Trends

Recycled polyester \(rPET\) fiber prices in Europe have been elevated relative to virgin polyester in recent years, with current levels around **€1\.5–2\.0 per kilogram** for high\-grade rPET fiber\. Industry price indices show that European rPET \(food\-grade\) averages about **$2\.13 per kg** \(≈€2\.0\) as of late 2025[businessanalytiq\.com](https://businessanalytiq.com/procurementanalytics/index/rpet-food-grade-price-index/#:~:text=Summary%20of%20recent%20rPET%20price,developments), markedly higher than in Asia \(≈$1\.09\) due to Europe’s strong demand and higher costs\. By comparison, virgin polyester staple fiber has traded closer to **$1\.0–1\.3 per kg** \(around $1,200–1,300 per metric ton\) in Europe during 2024[chemanalyst\.com](https://www.chemanalyst.com/Pricing-data/polyester-staple-fiber-32#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20The%20Polyester%20Staple%20Fiber,1205%2FMT%20CFR%20Hamburg%20in%20June)\. This means **rPET fiber in Europe often carries a significant premium over virgin**\. For example, as of April 30, 2025, **food\-grade rPET pellets were ~€1,680 per metric ton \(~€1\.68&#x2F;kg\)** in Europe – about **€686&#x2F;ton higher** than virgin PET resin at ~€994&#x2F;ton \(~€0\.99&#x2F;kg\)[texspacetoday\.com](https://www.texspacetoday.com/comparative-analysis-of-virgin-and-recycled-textile-raw-materials-market-overview-challenges-and-solutions/#:~:text=Cost%20is%20a%20significant%20factor,demand%20imbalances%20and%20recycling%20costs)\. In percentage terms, **European rPET was roughly 70% more expensive than virgin** PET resin at that time\. This premium has been persistent: across 2025, rPET in Europe is often **€600–700 per ton more costly** than virgin material[texspacetoday\.com](https://www.texspacetoday.com/comparative-analysis-of-virgin-and-recycled-textile-raw-materials-market-overview-challenges-and-solutions/#:~:text=different%20rPET%20grades%20depending%20on,sensitive%20lines), reflecting a **sustainability “green premium”** in the market\.

 

Global market analysis confirms that recycled fibers command higher prices\. A broad review in 2025 found **recycled textile fibers typically cost 1\.2 to 3 times more than comparable virgin fibers**[regenfabric\.com](https://regenfabric.com/the-true-cost-of-circular-fashion-7-key-drivers-shaping-recycled%E2%80%91material-prices-in-2025/#:~:text=you%20get%20for%20the%20cost)\. In the case of polyester specifically, **rPET fiber tends to be 5–20% pricier than virgin** on average under normal conditions[gh\-bags\.com](https://www.gh-bags.com/rpet-vs-virgin-polyester/#:~:text=2,rPET%20Is%20More%20Expensive)\. The exact premium fluctuates with market conditions: when oil prices \(and thus virgin polyester feedstock costs\) are low, virgin PET becomes cheaper and widens the gap, whereas **regulatory pressures or high sustainability demand narrow the gap** by keeping rPET prices firm[gh\-bags\.com](https://www.gh-bags.com/rpet-vs-virgin-polyester/#:~:text=Cost%20Trends)\. Notably, in early 2025 the rPET price surge \(around $1,810&#x2F;ton for clear flakes\) nearly erased the gap with virgin in some regions[langgengjayagroup\.co\.id](https://langgengjayagroup.co.id/blog/recycled-pet-vs-virgin-pet-a-comprehensive-comparison#:~:text=While%20rPET%20has%20traditionally%20been,the%20recyclate%20industrial%20yarn%20sector)\. In Europe, robust demand for recycled content \(driven by brand commitments and EU policy\) has in some periods pushed **rPET prices above virgin** – leading some price\-sensitive buyers to **reconsider virgin PET for cost reasons**[langgengjayagroup\.co\.id](https://langgengjayagroup.co.id/blog/recycled-pet-vs-virgin-pet-a-comprehensive-comparison#:~:text=In%20some%20regions%2C%20rPET%20is,manufacturers%20rethink%20their%20material%20choices)\. Overall, European rPET fiber prices in 2024–2025 have shown **volatility with an upward bias**, and slight recent softening \(\-1\.4% in the index\) suggests high prices may have incentivized more supply or tempered demand[businessanalytiq\.com](https://businessanalytiq.com/procurementanalytics/index/rpet-food-grade-price-index/#:~:text=Summary%20of%20recent%20rPET%20price,developments)\. But rPET remains substantially **more expensive than virgin polyester in Europe** under current market dynamics\.

## Trade Publication Insights on Pricing

Industry publications highlight several factors behind the **elevated price of recycled polyester in Europe**\. According to *TexSPACE Today*, cost is a major hurdle for rPET adoption: the price gap stems from **supply\-demand imbalances and higher recycling costs** \(collecting, processing waste bottles, etc\.\)[texspacetoday\.com](https://www.texspacetoday.com/comparative-analysis-of-virgin-and-recycled-textile-raw-materials-market-overview-challenges-and-solutions/#:~:text=Cost%20is%20a%20significant%20factor,demand%20imbalances%20and%20recycling%20costs)\. In Europe nearly **99% of “recycled” polyester comes from PET bottles**, not textile waste[texspacetoday\.com](https://www.texspacetoday.com/comparative-analysis-of-virgin-and-recycled-textile-raw-materials-market-overview-challenges-and-solutions/#:~:text=Nearly%2099,the%20loop%20within%20textiles%20themselves), which means rPET pricing is tied to the cost of collecting and processing plastic bottles\. As of mid\-2025, European recyclers faced tight supply and strong demand – a dynamic that kept **rPET prices elevated by €600\+ per ton over virgin**[texspacetoday\.com](https://www.texspacetoday.com/comparative-analysis-of-virgin-and-recycled-textile-raw-materials-market-overview-challenges-and-solutions/#:~:text=different%20rPET%20grades%20depending%20on,sensitive%20lines)\. This premium poses challenges for brands and mills, especially in price\-sensitive market segments, effectively **slowing rPET adoption in low\-margin product lines**[texspacetoday\.com](https://www.texspacetoday.com/comparative-analysis-of-virgin-and-recycled-textile-raw-materials-market-overview-challenges-and-solutions/#:~:text=different%20rPET%20grades%20depending%20on,sensitive%20lines)\. U\.S\. markets likewise saw an rPET premium \(~30–35% over virgin in 2024\)[texspacetoday\.com](https://www.texspacetoday.com/comparative-analysis-of-virgin-and-recycled-textile-raw-materials-market-overview-challenges-and-solutions/#:~:text=ImageFigure), but Europe’s premium has been even higher, reflecting **aggressive sustainability targets outpacing available recycled supply**\.

 

Trade reports also note that **European policy measures are influencing the market**\. The EU’s push for circular textiles \(e\.g\. mandatory textile waste collection by 2025 and Extended Producer Responsibility fees\) is expected to improve feedstock availability but also **increases short\-term costs**[texspacetoday\.com](https://www.texspacetoday.com/comparative-analysis-of-virgin-and-recycled-textile-raw-materials-market-overview-challenges-and-solutions/#:~:text=Regulatory%20Environment%20and%20Policy%20Drivers)[regenfabric\.com](https://regenfabric.com/the-true-cost-of-circular-fashion-7-key-drivers-shaping-recycled%E2%80%91material-prices-in-2025/#:~:text=,often%20mean%20higher%20costs%20per)\. Certifications like the Global Recycled Standard \(GRS\) are widely required in Europe, adding audit and chain\-of\-custody expenses that get factored into rPET pricing[gh\-bags\.com](https://www.gh-bags.com/rpet-vs-virgin-polyester/#:~:text=Why%20rPET%20Costs%20More)\. Some publications have cited extreme cost comparisons for advanced recycling: one report claimed **chemically recycled polyester from textiles in Europe could be ~2\.6× the cost of virgin PET** \(when comparing cutting\-edge depolymerization vs\. cheap virgin imports\)[linkedin\.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/polyester-recycling-really-26-times-more-expensive-than-holding-coske#:~:text=consultancy%20SYSTEMIQ%20in%20collaboration%20with,textile%29%20recycling%20as%20a%20whole)\. However, experts caution that such figures are not representative of mechanical bottle recycling \(which is far more common\)[linkedin\.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/polyester-recycling-really-26-times-more-expensive-than-holding-coske#:~:text=Is%20%E2%80%9Crecycling%20of%20polyester%E2%80%9D%20really,more%20expensive%20than%20virgin%20polyester)\. Mechanical rPET production is much more cost\-competitive than chemical textile\-to\-textile recycling, yet it still carries a notable **“green premium” in 2025**\. In summary, trade sources emphasize that **higher collection&#x2F;processing costs, certification overhead, and intense demand** for recycled content are keeping European rPET fiber prices **well above virgin fiber prices**[texspacetoday\.com](https://www.texspacetoday.com/comparative-analysis-of-virgin-and-recycled-textile-raw-materials-market-overview-challenges-and-solutions/#:~:text=Cost%20is%20a%20significant%20factor,demand%20imbalances%20and%20recycling%20costs)[gh\-bags\.com](https://www.gh-bags.com/rpet-vs-virgin-polyester/#:~:text=2,rPET%20Is%20More%20Expensive), even as the industry scales up\.

## Producer Pricing and Contract Structures

Recycled polyester fiber pricing is often determined through supplier quotes and contracts, rather than public commodity exchanges\. Major European rPET producers and importers negotiate prices based on **quality grade, volume, and contract duration**\. For instance, Finnish textile recycler Rester notes that a customer’s **annual volume and material quality will affect the price offered for recycling services&#x2F;fiber output**[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/en/questions-and-answers/#:~:text=How%20much%20recycling%20our%20end,textiles%20in%20Rester%20process%20cost)\. High\-volume orders can secure lower per\-kg rates, and consistent, clean feedstock \(e\.g\. uniform polyester scraps or clear bottle supply\) yields higher\-quality fiber that commands higher prices\. Many large buyers \(apparel brands, fiber fill manufacturers, etc\.\) pursue **multi\-year offtake agreements** with recyclers to lock in supply and more stable pricing[texspacetoday\.com](https://www.texspacetoday.com/comparative-analysis-of-virgin-and-recycled-textile-raw-materials-market-overview-challenges-and-solutions/#:~:text=Strategies%20to%20Address%20Key%20Challenges)\. Such contracts may include price\-escalation clauses tied to energy or virgin polyester indices[texspacetoday\.com](https://www.texspacetoday.com/comparative-analysis-of-virgin-and-recycled-textile-raw-materials-market-overview-challenges-and-solutions/#:~:text=Cost%20Premium%3A%C2%A0The%20rPET%20price%20premium,sensitive%20lines), aiming to mitigate volatility in rPET vs virgin price deltas\. This strategy is especially used in Europe to ensure access to certified recycled material despite tight markets\.

 

In open\-market transactions, **typical price ranges can be observed**\. According to industry estimates, in 2025 **virgin polyester staple fiber \(PSF\)** in bulk trades around $0\.85–$1\.05 per kg, whereas **recycled PSF** of similar grade costs roughly **$1\.10–$1\.40 per kg**[szoneierfabrics\.com](https://szoneierfabrics.com/polyester-clothing-cost-analysis-fabric-labor-and-logistics-breakdown/#:~:text=Polyester%20Clothing%20Cost%20Breakdown%3A%20Fabric,extra%20processing%20and%20sustainability)\. \(These figures align with the earlier noted €1\.5\+&#x2F;kg range in Europe\.\) Lower\-grade recycled fiber used for filling \(e\.g\. **“B\-grade” fiber with lower whiteness or shorter fibers\) is cheaper**, sometimes offered around **$0\.90–$1\.00&#x2F;kg** in large lots \(often by Asian suppliers for pillow&#x2F;cushion filling\)\. In contrast, **premium recycled filament yarn or high\-strength fiber** can exceed $1\.5&#x2F;kg due to additional processing to boost quality \(like solid\-state polycondensation to increase IV for spinning\)\. European rPET fiber suppliers typically price in **Euros per metric ton** for contract deals\. Recent market reports put **European recycled PSF around €1,500–€1,800&#x2F;ton** \(depending on grade\), versus **virgin PSF closer to €1,000–€1,200&#x2F;ton**[texspacetoday\.com](https://www.texspacetoday.com/comparative-analysis-of-virgin-and-recycled-textile-raw-materials-market-overview-challenges-and-solutions/#:~:text=Cost%20is%20a%20significant%20factor,demand%20imbalances%20and%20recycling%20costs)\. It’s common for European fiber producers to quote monthly or quarterly prices indexed to feedstock \(bottle bale or flake\) costs\. Additionally, **GRS\-certified fiber** may come at a slight surcharge to cover certification and tracing costs[gh\-bags\.com](https://www.gh-bags.com/rpet-vs-virgin-polyester/#:~:text=Why%20rPET%20Costs%20More), which buyers often accept in order to make official recycled content claims\. Overall, producer pricing reflects a balancing of **raw material costs, processing expenses, and the negotiated value of sustainability**\. Brands increasingly are willing to pay a premium, but many also demand price efficiency – leading to innovations like using **blends \(virgin \+ recycled\) to control cost** or sourcing rPET from lower\-cost regions for European production\.

## Quality Tiers: Premiums and Discounts

Not all recycled polyester is priced equally – **quality differences heavily influence price**\. The **color and purity of recycled PET feedstock** create distinct tiers of material value\. *Clear \(transparent\) PET flakes* derived from clear bottles are considered the **premium tier**, because they yield a nearly colorless recycled fiber that can be easily dyed any color or even reused in food\-grade applications\. These clear&#x2F;white rPET flakes are so versatile that they are used in **bottle\-to\-bottle recycling and high\-quality textile fibers**, and thus they **command the highest prices**[plasticbottlerecycling\.com](https://plasticbottlerecycling.com/pet-flake-quality-color-usability/#:~:text=Clear%2FTransparent%20Flakes%3A%20The%20Premium%20Tier)\. In fact, **high\-purity food\-grade clear rPET can sell for several times the price of low\-grade mixed\-color rPET** – the price difference is substantial[plasticbottlerecycling\.com](https://plasticbottlerecycling.com/pet-flake-quality-color-usability/#:~:text=3,reflection%20of%20their%20purity%2C%20versatility)\. A niche just below clear is *light blue flake* \(from lightly tinted water bottles\), which is also high\-value because it produces a clean light tint resin that many manufacturers find acceptable[plasticbottlerecycling\.com](https://plasticbottlerecycling.com/pet-flake-quality-color-usability/#:~:text=Light%20Blue%20Flakes%3A%20The%20Niche,Premium)\.

 

On the other end, *colored and mixed\-color rPET flakes* represent **discounted tiers**\. For example, **green\-tinted PET** from soda bottles has a stable market \(e\.g\. used in green strapping bands or dark fibers\) but is **less versatile**, so it trades cheaper than clear[plasticbottlerecycling\.com](https://plasticbottlerecycling.com/pet-flake-quality-color-usability/#:~:text=Green%20Flakes%3A%20The%20Industrial%20Workhorse)\. The lowest\-value is *mixed\-color “jazz” flakes*, which are an unsorted mix of various bottle colors \(amber, opaque, etc\.\) – these yield a dull gray&#x2F;brown recycled polymer only suitable for products where aesthetics don’t matter \(e\.g\. dark trash bags, insulation, or composite lumber\)[plasticbottlerecycling\.com](https://plasticbottlerecycling.com/pet-flake-quality-color-usability/#:~:text=Mixed,Tier)\. **Mixed\-color material can be bought for a fraction of the price of clear rPET**, reflecting its limited use\. In fiber markets, this translates similarly: **“White” recycled polyester fiber \(made from clear feedstock\)** is sold at a premium for spinning into yarn or white&#x2F;light\-colored fabrics, whereas **“grey” or colored recycled fiber** \(from mixed feeds\) is sold at a lower price, used for padding, felt, or dark textiles\. One source notes that **top\-tier clear rPET flakes&#x2F;yarn can fetch several\-fold higher prices than low\-grade mixed flakes** due to the purity and flexibility of the former[plasticbottlerecycling\.com](https://plasticbottlerecycling.com/pet-flake-quality-color-usability/#:~:text=3,reflection%20of%20their%20purity%2C%20versatility)\. Thus, buyers pay **quality premiums for bright, high\-IV, contaminant\-free recycled fiber**, while off\-color or lower\-IV fiber is deeply discounted\.

 

Other quality factors also yield premiums or discounts\. **Intrinsic viscosity \(IV\)** is critical for fiber\-strength – rPET with higher IV \(achieved by extra processing like SSP\) will cost more, as it can be used for stronger fibers and bottles\. **Certified quality** \(e\.g\. OEKO\-Tex standard for safety, or GRS certification for recycled content\) can add to price\. Conversely, fiber made from **lower\-grade feedstock or with minor contaminants** \(e\.g\. a bit of PVC contamination tolerable only in nonwovens\) may only be fit for **cheap filling fiber**\. In summary, the rPET market is **highly stratified by quality**: **clean, clear, high\-strength recycled polyester is a high\-value product**, while lower grades trade at bargain prices for limited applications\. Smart buyers will choose the grade that fits their end\-use: paying extra for premium recycled fiber when making apparel or high\-performance textiles, but opting for cheaper grades for insulation fill, furniture stuffing, or industrial uses\.

## Key Factors Affecting rPET Fiber Prices

Multiple **interrelated factors influence the price of recycled polyester fiber** in Europe:

- **Virgin Polyester Prices &amp; Oil Costs:** Virgin PET prices set the baseline\. When petrochemical feedstock \(PTA&#x2F;MEG derived from oil\) prices drop, virgin fiber gets cheaper, **widening the gap** with rPET[gh\-bags\.com](https://www.gh-bags.com/rpet-vs-virgin-polyester/#:~:text=Cost%20Trends)\. Conversely, if oil spikes or virgin production is constrained, virgin prices rise and rPET becomes relatively more competitive\.
- **Feedstock Supply and Quality:** The availability of **recyclable PET bottles or textile waste** directly impacts rPET cost\. Europe’s **bottle collection rates and bale prices** are a key driver – limited supply or higher collection costs push rPET prices up\. High\-quality feedstock \(clear bottles\) is expensive, whereas lower\-quality or imported flakes can reduce costs\. Seasonal or regional shortages in bottle supply can cause price spikes for rPET\. For example, strong demand from the fiber and packaging sectors in 2024 drove clear flake prices up globally[langgengjayagroup\.co\.id](https://langgengjayagroup.co.id/blog/recycled-pet-vs-virgin-pet-a-comprehensive-comparison#:~:text=While%20rPET%20has%20traditionally%20been,the%20recyclate%20industrial%20yarn%20sector)\.
- **Processing and Production Costs:** Recycling polyester involves additional steps \(collection, sorting, washing, remelting\) that **add cost compared to making virgin resin**[gh\-bags\.com](https://www.gh-bags.com/rpet-vs-virgin-polyester/#:~:text=Why%20rPET%20Costs%20More)\. Energy use is significant – **electricity and fuel prices in Europe** \(often higher than in Asia\) make rPET production more costly[regenfabric\.com](https://regenfabric.com/the-true-cost-of-circular-fashion-7-key-drivers-shaping-recycled%E2%80%91material-prices-in-2025/#:~:text=down%20to%20the%20fiber%20price,Extended%20Producer)\. If a recycler uses advanced processes to achieve food\-grade or high\-IV output, the extra **equipment and operating costs** raise the price of the recycled fiber\. In mechanical recycling, economies of scale matter: large plants can spread costs better than small ones\. *Chemical recycling*, where available, has extremely high capital and operation costs, translating to much higher price of output \(thus not yet competitive for bulk fiber\)[linkedin\.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/polyester-recycling-really-26-times-more-expensive-than-holding-coske#:~:text=consultancy%20SYSTEMIQ%20in%20collaboration%20with,textile%29%20recycling%20as%20a%20whole)[regenfabric\.com](https://regenfabric.com/the-true-cost-of-circular-fashion-7-key-drivers-shaping-recycled%E2%80%91material-prices-in-2025/#:~:text=or%20plastic%20pellets%20for%20polyester,down%20to%20the%20fiber%20price)\.
- **Certification and Compliance:** Ensuring recycled content claims and meeting regulations add cost\. **GRS certification, transaction certificates \(TCs\) for each batch, and audits** introduce administrative costs that get reflected in pricing[gh\-bags\.com](https://www.gh-bags.com/rpet-vs-virgin-polyester/#:~:text=Why%20rPET%20Costs%20More)\. In Europe, **Extended Producer Responsibility \(EPR\) fees** for plastics can effectively increase the cost of raw recycled material \(if bottle collectors pass on fees\)[regenfabric\.com](https://regenfabric.com/the-true-cost-of-circular-fashion-7-key-drivers-shaping-recycled%E2%80%91material-prices-in-2025/#:~:text=,often%20mean%20higher%20costs%20per)\. Upcoming **Digital Product Passports** will require data tracking for recycled fiber, potentially adding overhead[regenfabric\.com](https://regenfabric.com/the-true-cost-of-circular-fashion-7-key-drivers-shaping-recycled%E2%80%91material-prices-in-2025/#:~:text=,often%20mean%20higher%20costs%20per)\. These compliance\-related expenses make rPET a pricier input than an equivalent virgin fiber which has none of these requirements\.
- **Market Demand vs\. Capacity:** In recent years, **surging demand from brands for recycled polyester** \(to meet sustainability targets\) has outpaced the available recycled supply, especially in Europe\. This demand\-pull exerts **upward pressure on prices**\. When **recycling capacity is tight** or flake import volumes are limited by logistics, buyers bid up prices to secure material\. Conversely, if new rPET plants come online or if demand softens \(e\.g\. during economic slowdowns\), prices can stabilize or decline\. The slight price dips seen in late 2025[businessanalytiq\.com](https://businessanalytiq.com/procurementanalytics/index/rpet-food-grade-price-index/#:~:text=Summary%20of%20recent%20rPET%20price,developments) may indicate easing demand or improved supply\. Overall, the balance of how many buyers *must have* rPET vs\. how much material is available will sway the price\.
- **Regulatory Environment:** Europe’s regulatory landscape indirectly affects price\. **Recycled content mandates and waste directives** \(like the EU requiring certain % recycled content in bottles, or mandating textile recycling\) effectively create a **floor for demand**, keeping prices from falling\. At the same time, government incentives or subsidies \(or lack thereof\) for recycling infrastructure can affect cost structure\. Policy can thus both drive demand up and potentially add compliance costs, as noted above\. The net effect in the EU has been rPET prices staying relatively high due to guaranteed demand from sustainability commitments\.
- **Quality Grades and End\-Use Requirements:** As discussed, the **grade of rPET \(color, IV, purity\)** needed for a given end use will influence price\. Fiber intended for high\-end textiles or food\-contact applications must be top\-grade and is priced at a premium\. If a buyer can utilize lower\-grade fiber \(e\.g\. for insulation or geotextiles\), they can pay far less\. Thus, the average market price is an amalgam of different tiers – with the **highest prices for the best material** and bargain prices for the worst\. The mix of demand across these grades \(for example, if more apparel makers all chase after clear\-grade rPET at the same time\) can push the **market index upward disproportionately**\.
- **Contract Length and Purchase Volume:** Lastly, the terms of trade affect pricing\. Large\-volume, long\-term contracts can secure somewhat lower per\-kg prices \(in exchange for guaranteed offtake to the recycler\)\. Spot purchases of smaller lots often cost more per kg\. European fiber producers often give better rates to stable partners or consortiums that commit to regular purchases\. This means companies investing in multi\-year recycled fiber sourcing can manage costs better than those buying ad\-hoc on the spot market[texspacetoday\.com](https://www.texspacetoday.com/comparative-analysis-of-virgin-and-recycled-textile-raw-materials-market-overview-challenges-and-solutions/#:~:text=Cost%20Premium%3A%C2%A0The%20rPET%20price%20premium,sensitive%20lines)\.

In conclusion, **recycled polyester fiber pricing in Europe** floats higher than virgin polyester due to a confluence of these factors – from raw material constraints and extra processing needs to market dynamics and policy pressures\. As of 2024–2025, buyers can expect to pay on the order of **€1\.5–2\+ per kg for good\-quality recycled polyester fiber**, with actual prices varying by deal and grade\. The **price range per kg reflects quality tiers** \(cheap mixed\-color fiber under €1&#x2F;kg vs\. premium clear fiber well above €1&#x2F;kg\) and the **“green premium”** that currently exists\. Going forward, many of these factors \(e\.g\. scaling up collection, technological improvements, and regulatory changes\) will determine if this price gap narrows\. For now, however, **rPET commands a notable premium in Europe**, and companies weigh these costs against their sustainability goals when sourcing materials[texspacetoday\.com](https://www.texspacetoday.com/comparative-analysis-of-virgin-and-recycled-textile-raw-materials-market-overview-challenges-and-solutions/#:~:text=Cost%20is%20a%20significant%20factor,demand%20imbalances%20and%20recycling%20costs)[gh\-bags\.com](https://www.gh-bags.com/rpet-vs-virgin-polyester/#:~:text=2,rPET%20Is%20More%20Expensive)\.
