# Companies Sourcing Recycled Polyester in Finland

Finland has several companies integrating recycled polyester into textiles and technical materials\. These firms – spanning fashion, workwear, insulation, and industrial products – effectively compete for recycled polyester feedstock \(whether from post\-consumer textiles or PET plastics\)\. Below is a list of notable players, with their scale and applications:

## Textile Manufacturers &amp; Fashion Brands \(Recycled Polyester Content\)

- **Pure Waste Textiles \(Finland\)** – A pioneer in circular apparel, Pure Waste produces **100% recycled** yarns, fabrics and garments\. Its products are a blend of ~60% recycled cotton cutting waste and 40% **recycled polyester** made from plastic bottles[purewaste\.com](https://purewaste.com/360-impact/?srsltid=AfmBOorypPC5oLzRgRQUteg43qRuOiuwqOOR_-TT4WfnEBmKXAW7lZeE#:~:text=Our%20primary%20raw%20material%20is,products%20made%20from%20virgin%20materials)\. Since 2013, Pure Waste has recycled over **650,000 kg** of textile waste into new clothing[purewaste\.com](https://purewaste.com/360-impact/?srsltid=AfmBOorypPC5oLzRgRQUteg43qRuOiuwqOOR_-TT4WfnEBmKXAW7lZeE#:~:text=Using%20recycled%20materials%20instead%20of,a%20new%20life%20as%20clothes)\. By sorting pre\-consumer cotton waste by color \(to avoid re\-dyeing\) and mixing it with rPET fibers, Pure Waste creates t\-shirts, sweatshirts and other garments with a **carbon footprint ~50% lower** than virgin equivalents[purewaste\.com](https://purewaste.com/360-impact/?srsltid=AfmBOorypPC5oLzRgRQUteg43qRuOiuwqOOR_-TT4WfnEBmKXAW7lZeE#:~:text=Our%20primary%20raw%20material%20is,products%20made%20from%20virgin%20materials)[nefco\.int](https://www.nefco.int/news/pure-waste-receives-financing-from-nefco-to-boost-its-recycled-waste-based-textiles-internationally/#:~:text=The%20process%20of%20creating%20Pure,knitting%20and%20sewing%20sustainable%20garments)\. \(Production is mainly in India, but the company is Finnish\.\) This small but growing volume of recycled fiber use makes Pure Waste a direct competitor for recycled feedstock\.
- **Touchpoint Oy** – A Finnish workwear manufacturer and Rester’s founding owner, Touchpoint uses *“more than 80% recycled materials”* in its functional workwear[circitnord\.com](https://circitnord.com/inspiration-cases/cecase-56/#:~:text=Touchpoint%20produces%20functional%20workwear%20using,like%20plastic%20from%20plastic%20bottles)\. Much of this is **recycled polyester from PET bottles**, which Touchpoint uses in fabrics for corporate uniforms \(e\.g\. fast\-food uniforms made with rPET\)[facebook\.com](https://www.facebook.com/touchpointoffice/posts/from-plastic-bottles-to-workwear-from-workwear-to-terrace-tablestouchpoint-have-/1088929349448947/#:~:text=Touchpoint%20,polyester%20from%20recycled%20plastic)\. In 2024 Touchpoint launched a new workwear fabric called **ReTouch** containing **over 10% Rester’s recycled fiber** \(from end\-of\-life workwear\) blended with cotton&#x2F;polyester[touchpointww\.com](https://www.touchpointww.com/news/closing-the-loop-touchpoint-launches-new-workwear-fabric-retouch#:~:text=The%20long,entirely%20from%20virgin%20raw%20materials)\. This proven closed\-loop fabric meets heavy\-duty durability standards and has ~10% lower carbon emissions than virgin fabric[touchpointww\.com](https://www.touchpointww.com/news/closing-the-loop-touchpoint-launches-new-workwear-fabric-retouch#:~:text=The%20long,entirely%20from%20virgin%20raw%20materials)\. Touchpoint’s significant use of rPET \(e\.g\. *345,000 recycled plastic bottles* were used for one client’s uniforms[touchpointww\.com](https://www.touchpointww.com/cases/sol#:~:text=SOL%20,345%20000%20recycled%20plastic)\) and its new uptake of Rester fibers position it as a major consumer of recycled polyester feedstock\.
- **Reima Oy** – Finland’s leading children’s outdoor clothing brand, Reima has made strong recycled material commitments\. As of 2022, **100% of Reima’s winter garment insulation \(wadding\) is recycled polyester**, and **50% of all polyester fabrics** they use contain at least 50% recycled fiber[us\.reima\.com](https://us.reima.com/sustainability/materials-and-innovations#:~:text=%23%20100,is%20certified%20organic)\. For example, starting autumn&#x2F;winter 2022, all the fluffy thermal insulation in Reima’s kids’ jackets and snowsuits is made from rPET fibers[us\.reima\.com](https://us.reima.com/sustainability/materials-and-innovations#:~:text=Keeping%20synthetic%20materials%20in%20the,loop)\. Reima publicly notes the much smaller carbon footprint of recycled polyester and is systematically increasing its share[us\.reima\.com](https://us.reima.com/sustainability/materials-and-innovations#:~:text=Keeping%20synthetic%20materials%20in%20the,loop)\. With high production volumes \(Reima sells globally\), its demand for recycled PET fiber is substantial – making Reima a significant competitor for rPET supply \(mostly sourced from bottles\)\.
- **Halti and Other Outdoor Brands** – Finnish outdoor apparel brands like **Halti** also utilize recycled polyester at scale\. For instance, Halti’s award\-winning Bergga Parka is a mono\-material **polyester jacket where most of the fabric is recycled**[ispo\.com](https://www.ispo.com/en/promotion/ispo-award-winner-halti-bergga-warm-parka#:~:text=The%20Bergga%20Warm%20Parka%20by,material%20means), and its shell fabrics \(ripstop, softshell\) are often made of **100% recycled PET\-bottle polyester**[halti\.com](https://halti.com/pages/materials#:~:text=All%20Softshell%20used%20in%20Halti,Ltd)\. Similarly, ski wear brand **Rukka** and others have introduced recycled\-polyester fabrics or linings in recent collections\. While these brands may not disclose exact tonnages, their commitments \(e\.g\. Halti using 50% rPET content in certain technical fabrics[scandinavianoutdooraward\.com](https://scandinavianoutdooraward.com/halti-reissu-w-dx-3l-jacket/#:~:text=HALTI%3A%20REISSU%20W%20DX%203L,made%20of%20polyester%2C%20so)\) indicate growing consumption of recycled polyester yarns in Finland’s sportswear sector\.
- **Marimekko** – The iconic Finnish design house is beginning to close the loop on its textiles\. Marimekko partnered with Rester in 2022 to recycle all cutting scraps and end\-of\-line textiles from its Helsinki printing factory[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/news/marimekko-kierrattaa-omasta-tuotannosta-syntyvat-poistotekstiilit-yhteistyo-resterin-kanssa-tukee-yhtion-tavoitetta-kiertotalouden-mukaisesta-arvoketjusta/#:~:text=Marimekko%20and%20Rester%20Oy%20have,to%20push%20the%20industry%20forward)\. Rester mechanically opens Marimekko’s cotton and poly\-cotton offcuts back into fiber\. Marimekko is *“exploring using the recycled fibers made from its own production waste in new products”*[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/news/marimekko-kierrattaa-omasta-tuotannosta-syntyvat-poistotekstiilit-yhteistyo-resterin-kanssa-tukee-yhtion-tavoitetta-kiertotalouden-mukaisesta-arvoketjusta/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20goal%20is%20to%20continuously,Business%20Development%20Officer%20at%20Marimekko) to achieve a circular value chain\. While volumes are modest \(a single factory’s scraps\), this initiative means Marimekko could eventually source **Rester’s recycled fiber** as feedstock for certain fabrics – making it a future consumer of recycled polyester \(in blends\) for its home textiles or fashion lines[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/news/marimekko-kierrattaa-omasta-tuotannosta-syntyvat-poistotekstiilit-yhteistyo-resterin-kanssa-tukee-yhtion-tavoitetta-kiertotalouden-mukaisesta-arvoketjusta/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20goal%20is%20to%20continuously,Business%20Development%20Officer%20at%20Marimekko)\.

## Insulation &amp; Construction Material Manufacturers

- **Ewona Oy – “Ewonawool” Insulation Boards:** Ewona produces thermal and acoustic insulation mats&#x2F;boards from **sustainably recycled polyester fiber**\. Branded *Ewonawool*, this insulation is made in Finland using **100% recycled fibers**, and it carries the Allergy and Asthma Federation label due to its dust\-free, clean composition[etsnord\.com](https://www.etsnord.com/news/safe-finnish-materials-for-sound-absorption/#:~:text=Ewonawool%20insulation%20board%20uses%20dust,also%20the%20possibility%20of%20reusing)\. Ewonawool polyester wool does *not* use any chemical binders – fibers are heat\-bonded – resulting in an allergy\-safe product[ewona\.fi](https://ewona.fi/tuoteryhmat/eristeet/#:~:text=Allergiavapaa%20Ewonawool)\. These boards are used in building construction \(walls, attics\) and HVAC systems\. For example, HVAC manufacturer ETS NORD uses Ewonawool as the sound\-dampening liner in its air ducts and silencers[etsnord\.com](https://www.etsnord.com/news/safe-finnish-materials-for-sound-absorption/#:~:text=ETS%20NORD%E2%80%99s%20silencers%20use%20Finnish,particles%20into%20the%20indoor%20air)\. While Ewona’s production volume isn’t publicly stated, its niche as *the only Finnish insulation board made from recycled fiber*[etsnord\.com](https://www.etsnord.com/news/safe-finnish-materials-for-sound-absorption/#:~:text=ETS%20NORD%E2%80%99s%20silencers%20use%20Finnish,particles%20into%20the%20indoor%20air) suggests a notable annual consumption of recycled PET fiber\. Each square meter of insulation effectively locks up a certain amount of PET that would otherwise be waste\. Ewona likely sources its fiber from domestic recyclers \(like Rester or others\), so it competes for high\-quality recycled polyester staple fiber to meet demand for green building materials\.
- **Intermedius Oy – Recycled PET Felt Producer:** Intermedius \(based in Virrat, FI\) manufactures **needle\-punched polyester felts** using **100% recycled PET fibers**[intermedius\.fi](https://www.intermedius.fi/en/products-and-services/polyester-felt/#:~:text=High,from%20Recycled%20PET%20Fibers)\. The fibers come from **various recycled polyester objects** \(e\.g\. bottles, packaging\), which Intermedius processes into nonwoven felt rolls[intermedius\.fi](https://www.intermedius.fi/en/products-and-services/polyester-felt/#:~:text=The%20world%E2%80%99s%20oceans%20are%20drowning,new%20growth%20opportunities%20for%20industry)\. This high\-quality PET felt has multiple applications: acoustic panels and interior decor, designer furniture padding, technical textiles, footwear components, and thermal&#x2F;acoustic insulation layers[intermedius\.fi](https://www.intermedius.fi/en/products-and-services/polyester-felt/#:~:text=,new%20life%20as%20felt)\. Intermedius highlights that its PET felts are thermoformable and certified safe \(OEKO\-Tex 100, M1 emission class\)[intermedius\.fi](https://www.intermedius.fi/en/products-and-services/polyester-felt/#:~:text=Polyester%20felt%20has%20numerous%20good,heavy%20metals%20or%20formaldehyde%20residues), making them suitable for **automotive parts** \(headliners, door panels\) and **industrial filters** as well[intermedius\.fi](https://www.intermedius.fi/en/products-and-services/polyester-felt/#:~:text=,felt%20is%20used)\. The company’s customer case studies include **soundproof office phone booths** lined with their recycled felt and **automotive OEM parts** made from it[intermedius\.fi](https://www.intermedius.fi/en/products-and-services/polyester-felt/#:~:text=,felt%20is%20used)[intermedius\.fi](https://www.intermedius.fi/en/products-and-services/polyester-felt/#:~:text=Customer%20stories)\. Intermedius likely produces on an industrial scale, supplying both domestic and export markets\. Its use of **recycled PET feedstock** \(instead of virgin polyester fiber\) positions it as a direct competitor for rPET fiber supply\. Every ton of PET felt they produce diverts roughly a ton of plastic from oceans&#x2F;landfills[intermedius\.fi](https://www.intermedius.fi/en/products-and-services/polyester-felt/#:~:text=The%20world%E2%80%99s%20oceans%20are%20drowning,new%20growth%20opportunities%20for%20industry), so their annual throughput \(not publicly disclosed\) can be inferred to be in the hundreds of tons range\. This makes Intermedius a significant player consuming recycled polyester in Finland, especially for non\-textile technical applications\.
- **Other Building Material Uses:** In addition to Ewona and Intermedius, other Finnish construction products leverage recycled polyester\. For instance, **acoustic wall panels** sold by firms like Akuprintti and Moodfelt are made of PET felt derived from **recycled plastic bottles** \(often &gt;50–100% recycled content\)\. These panels, used in offices and schools, further contribute to demand for recycled PET fiber\. Another example: **Finnfoam Oy**, a Finnish insulation board maker, has experimented with chemical recycling of PET to make polyols for polyurethane foam boards[inosence\.com](https://inosence.com/?page_id=201#:~:text=Inosence%20Polyol%20Oy%20specializes%20in,We%20are%20committed)[kestavyysloikka\.ymparisto\.fi](https://kestavyysloikka.ymparisto.fi/en/energy-efficiency-with-recycled-plastic/#:~:text=Energy%20Efficiency%20with%20Recycled%20Plastic,production%20of%20PIR%20insulation%20boards)\. *Inosence Polyol Oy* in Kotka supplies Finnfoam with polyester polyol made from **waste PET bottles**, replacing some virgin raw material in PIR insulation[inosence\.com](https://inosence.com/?page_id=201#:~:text=Inosence%20Polyol%20Oy%20specializes%20in,We%20are%20committed)[kestavyysloikka\.ymparisto\.fi](https://kestavyysloikka.ymparisto.fi/en/energy-efficiency-with-recycled-plastic/#:~:text=Energy%20Efficiency%20with%20Recycled%20Plastic,production%20of%20PIR%20insulation%20boards)\. While not a fiber application, it underscores that even the construction insulation sector is sourcing recycled polyester \(in liquid form\) at commercial scale\. Overall, the Finnish building materials industry – from fiber\-based acoustic boards to foam insulation – is steadily increasing its uptake of recycled PET, competing for the same pool of reclaimed polyester, be it in fiber or resin form\.

## Automotive &amp; Industrial Applications of Recycled Polyester

- **Automotive Textiles &amp; Components:** Recycled polyester fibers find use in various automotive parts, typically as nonwovens for sound insulation, carpeting, or molded panels\. In Finland, **Intermedius Oy** \(mentioned above\) supplies thermoformable PET felts for **car headliners, door panels, and trunk liners**[intermedius\.fi](https://www.intermedius.fi/en/products-and-services/polyester-felt/#:~:text=,felt%20is%20used)\. These felts, made entirely from recycled PET, meet industry specs \(e\.g\. for dimensional stability and even antistatic ESD requirements in safety footwear\)[intermedius\.fi](https://www.intermedius.fi/en/products-and-services/polyester-felt/#:~:text=,felt%20is%20used)\. Although Finland doesn’t have large\-scale auto manufacturing, Finnish\-made recycled felts can be and are exported to European automotive suppliers\. In one pilot under the Textile 2\.0 program, **12 tons of sorted post\-consumer textiles from Turku** were shipped to the Netherlands to be recycled into auto **car seat padding and insulation** for EU carmakers[finland\.fi](https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-fashion-gives-new-life-to-old-fabric/#:~:text=Waste)\. This demonstrates a clear end\-market: the **European automotive industry** is hungry for recycled fiber, effectively competing with textile manufacturers for feedstock\. Global auto suppliers \(like Autoneum, Adient, etc\.\) now commonly use shoddy and rPET fibers in insulation mats – so any Finnish recycler producing suitable polyester fiber \(such as Rester\) could sell into that market\. Finnish textile waste thus can be seen as a valuable commodity for automotive applications, with demand likely to grow as car OEMs seek more recycled content\.
- **Dafecor Oy \(Industrial Nonwovens\):** **Dafecor** is a Finnish company \(est\. 2011\) that recycles textile waste into various industrial products, showcasing open\-loop applications\. Operating factories in Turenki \(and previously Jyväskylä\), Dafecor processes both **household and industry textile waste** – cutting&#x2F;shredding it back to fiber and needling or pressing it into new materials[stjm\.fi](https://www.stjm.fi/en/jasenyritys/dafecor-oy-2/#:~:text=Dafecor%20utilises%20textile%20waste%20on,the%20furniture%20industry%20and%20gardening)\. Their annual output is relatively small \(on the order of a couple **hundred tonnes** of recycled products\) but diverse[stjm\.fi](https://www.stjm.fi/en/jasenyritys/dafecor-oy-2/#:~:text=Dafecor%20utilises%20textile%20waste%20on,the%20furniture%20industry%20and%20gardening)\. Key products include: **oil\-absorbent mats and special carpets** \(nonwoven pads that can soak up fuel&#x2F;oil spills up to 18× their weight\)[tana\.fi](https://tana.fi/stories/recycling-old-clothing-and-other-textiles/#:~:text=Recycled%20materials%20offer%20multiple%20options,prevent%20textiles%20ending%20up%20in), **industrial wiping cloths and towels**, **parquet underlay felt** for flooring, and coarse **furniture padding&#x2F;upholstery fills**[finland\.fi](https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-fashion-gives-new-life-to-old-fabric/#:~:text=and%20give%20products%20a%20new,%E2%80%9D)\. Notably, Dafecor sources waste clothing from retail chains and laundries \(e\.g\. Lindström’s hotel linens\) that would otherwise be burned[finland\.fi](https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-fashion-gives-new-life-to-old-fabric/#:~:text=Another%20southern%20Finnish%20company%2C%20Dafecor%2C,%E2%80%9D)\. CEO Risto Saha notes *“we recycle surplus textiles into fibers and give products a new life cycle”*, such as turning old uniforms into absorption mats for environmental maintenance[finland\.fi](https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-fashion-gives-new-life-to-old-fabric/#:~:text=Another%20southern%20Finnish%20company%2C%20Dafecor%2C,%E2%80%9D)\. While much of Dafecor’s feedstock is cotton or mixed fiber, polyester components are certainly part of the blend – and the company’s existence \(long the only commercial textile recycler in Finland before Rester\) makes it a competitor for any recoverable textile feedstock\. By 2016, **Dafecor’s products enjoyed steady demand** in construction and technical maintenance sectors[finland\.fi](https://finland.fi/arts-culture/finnish-fashion-gives-new-life-to-old-fabric/#:~:text=and%20give%20products%20a%20new,%E2%80%9D), proving that even lower\-grade recycled fiber has a market\. As recycling scales up in Finland, Dafecor’s continued need for input material \(textile waste\) means it will vie with newer recyclers like Rester&#x2F;LSJH for certain waste streams, albeit at a smaller scale\.
- **Filtration and Other Industrial Uses:** Recycled polyester is also being used in technical textiles like **filters and geotextiles**\. For example, Intermedius’s recycled PET felts are used in **liquid and air filters for steel factories**[intermedius\.fi](https://www.intermedius.fi/en/products-and-services/polyester-felt/#:~:text=,Applications%20requiring%20protection%20treatment)\. Such industrial nonwovens can replace virgin polyester or polypropylene fibers in filter media, offering sustainability gains\. Additionally, some Finnish\-made **geotextile fabrics** \(for infrastructure\) include recycled PET content \(though much of this is imported fiber\)\. As sustainability becomes a procurement criterion, we can expect Finnish industrial textile users \(filters, composites, etc\.\) to demand more recycled polyester\. This latent demand puts pressure on feedstock supply – industrial users often require consistent quality fiber in bulk, potentially driving chemical recycling ventures or high\-grade mechanical fiber production\. In summary, beyond clothing, **multiple industrial sectors \(automotive, oil &amp; chemical, filtration\)** are sourcing recycled polyester fiber in Finland, soaking up available recycled feedstock with applications that range from cleaning up oil spills to quieting car cabins\.

## Rester Oy’s Customer Base and Other Feedstock Competitors

Finland’s first large\-scale textile recycling plant, **Rester Oy**, began operations in Paimio in late 2021\. With capacity to process ~**12,000 tonnes** of end\-of\-life textiles per year \(about 10% of Finland’s textile waste\)[knowledge\-hub\.circle\-economy\.com](https://knowledge-hub.circle-economy.com/article/9187#:~:text=Finland%27s%20first%20industrial%20end,transition%20toward%20a%20circular%20economy)[knowledge\-hub\.circle\-economy\.com](https://knowledge-hub.circle-economy.com/article/9187#:~:text=The%20Paimio%20EoL%20textile%20refinement,of%20Finland%E2%80%99s%20textile%20waste), Rester has rapidly become a hub for circular textile feedstock\. It **mechanically shreds and “opens” textiles into fiber**, which is then baled and sold as recycled raw material\. Rester’s **customer base spans two sides**: **\(1\)** companies that *supply* waste textiles, and **\(2\)** manufacturers who *buy* the recycled fiber for their products[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/news/a-collaboration-to-revolutionise-textile-recycling/#:~:text=We%20are%20building%20global%20and,utilized%20to%20its%20fullest%20potential)\. This creates a new ecosystem of cooperation – and some competition – around textile feedstock\. Key players include:

- **Lindström Group** – *Supplier and User\.* Lindström is a major Finnish workwear and textile service company, and a driving force in textile circularity\. It rents uniforms, mats, and linens across 23 countries, generating significant textile waste at end\-of\-life\. Lindström **set a target to recycle 100% of its textile waste by 2025**[textile\-services\.eu](https://www.textile-services.eu/news/from-responsibility-targets-to-actions---lindstr-m-develops-the-closed-loop-for-textiles.cfm#:~:text=By%202025%2C%20Lindstr%C3%B6m%20Group%20will,loop%20recycling%20system%20for%20textiles)\. To achieve this, it became Rester’s second\-largest shareholder in 2022[textile\-services\.eu](https://www.textile-services.eu/news/from-responsibility-targets-to-actions---lindstr-m-develops-the-closed-loop-for-textiles.cfm#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20important%20partnerships,largest%20owner%20in%202022) and now channels all its unusable workwear, hotel linens, etc\., to recycling\. Lindström sends **worn\-out workwear to Rester**, whose output fiber is then used by fabric partners to make new workwear\. In fact, Lindström, Rester, and Italian fabric maker **Klopman** have jointly developed a new poly\-cotton workwear fabric containing a percentage of recycled fiber from Lindström’s own discarded uniforms[textile\-services\.eu](https://www.textile-services.eu/news/from-responsibility-targets-to-actions---lindstr-m-develops-the-closed-loop-for-textiles.cfm#:~:text=Pilot%20projects%20aimed%20at%20closed,making%20also%20took%20into%20account)\. The first pilot fabrics have passed industrial washing tests and even a **hotel staff uniform collection made with recycled fibers** has been launched[textile\-services\.eu](https://www.textile-services.eu/news/from-responsibility-targets-to-actions---lindstr-m-develops-the-closed-loop-for-textiles.cfm#:~:text=Pilot%20projects%20aimed%20at%20closed,making%20also%20took%20into%20account)\. This closed\-loop pilot \(old uniforms → fiber → new uniforms\) is scaling up\. Lindström thus competes for Rester’s output \(to reuse in its products\) while also being a major source of feedstock \(its waste\)\. Volume\-wise, Lindström handles tens of thousands of garments yearly; by 2025 *all* of that \(several thousand tonnes of textiles\) will go into recycling rather than incineration[textile\-services\.eu](https://www.textile-services.eu/news/from-responsibility-targets-to-actions---lindstr-m-develops-the-closed-loop-for-textiles.cfm#:~:text=By%202025%2C%20Lindstr%C3%B6m%20Group%20will,loop%20recycling%20system%20for%20textiles)\. Lindström’s commitment means it is effectively **locking in a share of Rester’s capacity** for its own circular needs, which could limit feedstock available to others\. At the same time, Lindström historically also worked with **Dafecor** \(e\.g\. sending 100% of Comforta hotel linens to Dafecor for rag&#x2F;insulation reuse[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/we-ensure-that-textiles-are-reused/#:~:text=We%20ensure%20that%20textiles%20are,can%20no%20longer%20be%20used)\)\. As more recyclers emerge, Lindström will allocate waste to the best uses – but overall, its aggressive recycling goals make it a cornerstone participant \(and competitor for recycling capacity\)\.
- **Lounais\-Suomen Jätehuolto \(LSJH\)** – *Municipal waste company\.* LSJH is the southwest Finland municipal waste firm \(owned by 17 cities\) leading Finland’s **post\-consumer textile collection**\. From January 2023, *all Finnish households’ textile waste* must be collected separately by law, and LSJH coordinates this nationally\. LSJH partnered with Rester to build the Paimio plant, and they operate *one* of the two lines there dedicated to **household textiles**[knowledge\-hub\.circle\-economy\.com](https://knowledge-hub.circle-economy.com/article/9187#:~:text=Solution)\. In practice, LSJH sorts collected clothing and home textiles \(using automated sorting by fiber type\) and feeds suitable fractions to Rester’s mechanical line\. Rester and LSJH together expect to process **12,000 t&#x2F;year** at Paimio[knowledge\-hub\.circle\-economy\.com](https://knowledge-hub.circle-economy.com/article/9187#:~:text=Finland%27s%20first%20industrial%20end,transition%20toward%20a%20circular%20economy), but even that is only ~10% of Finland’s textile waste, so LSJH also prepares to scale further\. Indeed, LSJH is constructing a **full\-scale textile refinement plant** \(sorting facility\) in the Turku region to handle all household textiles in cooperation with other waste companies[infinitedfiber\.com](https://infinitedfiber.com/blog/2021/04/20/infinited-fiber-company-plans-to-build-eur-220-mln-flagship-factory-in-finland/#:~:text=Finnish%20waste%20management%20company%20Lounais,owned%20waste%20management%20companies)\. Sorted output from LSJH can go to multiple recyclers – mechanical \(like Rester\) or chemical\. LSJH has already **committed a large share of its collected textiles to the Infinited Fiber Company’s upcoming plant** \(see below\)[infinitedfiber\.com](https://infinitedfiber.com/blog/2021/04/20/infinited-fiber-company-plans-to-build-eur-220-mln-flagship-factory-in-finland/#:~:text=Finnish%20waste%20management%20company%20Lounais,owned%20waste%20management%20companies)\. In essence, LSJH controls the **feedstock flow** from Finnish consumers and will allocate it among recycling channels\. This makes LSJH a *gatekeeper* rather than a competitor; however, from the perspective of someone seeking recycled polyester, LSJH’s partnerships determine availability\. If LSJH directs more poly\-rich waste to Rester \(mechanical\) vs\. to other processes, it affects how much recycled fiber enters the market\. Any company wanting to source Finnish textile waste \(for polyester recovery or otherwise\) likely must collaborate with LSJH or work on its periphery\. Thus LSJH, by centralizing feedstock, **influences competition** – essentially determining which recycling initiatives get the “fuel” \(textile feedstock\) they need to run\.
- **Infinited Fiber Company \(IFC\)** – *Emerging large consumer of textile waste \(chemical route\)\.* IFC is a Finnish startup\-turned\-scaleup that has developed a technology to chemically convert cellulose\-rich textile waste into a new fiber called **Infinna™** \(a cotton\-like regenerated fiber\)\. In 2021, IFC announced a flagship factory in Finland with **30,000 tonne per year** capacity, slated to be operational by 2025[infinitedfiber\.com](https://infinitedfiber.com/blog/2021/04/20/infinited-fiber-company-plans-to-build-eur-220-mln-flagship-factory-in-finland/#:~:text=Infinited%20Fiber%20Company%20currently%20operates,consumer%20textile%20waste%20as%20feedstock)[infinitedfiber\.com](https://infinitedfiber.com/blog/2021/04/20/infinited-fiber-company-plans-to-build-eur-220-mln-flagship-factory-in-finland/#:~:text=Espoo%20and%20Valkeakoski%2C%20Finland%2C%20with,consumer%20textile%20waste%20as%20feedstock)\. Critically, **IFC will use post\-consumer textile waste as its feedstock**, sourced via LSJH[infinitedfiber\.com](https://infinitedfiber.com/blog/2021/04/20/infinited-fiber-company-plans-to-build-eur-220-mln-flagship-factory-in-finland/#:~:text=Espoo%20and%20Valkeakoski%2C%20Finland%2C%20with,consumer%20textile%20waste%20as%20feedstock)[infinitedfiber\.com](https://infinitedfiber.com/blog/2021/04/20/infinited-fiber-company-plans-to-build-eur-220-mln-flagship-factory-in-finland/#:~:text=Finnish%20waste%20management%20company%20Lounais,owned%20waste%20management%20companies)\. The process targets **cotton\-rich textiles \(cellulose\)** – for example, old cotton clothes, which IFC will dissolve and re\-polymerize into new fibers\. However, most textiles also contain polyester \(e\.g\. poly\-cotton blends\)\. In IFC’s model, LSJH will **optically sort textiles into fiber classes**; the cotton fraction feeds IFC, while the leftover polyester fraction could be directed to mechanical recyclers like Rester[infinitedfiber\.com](https://infinitedfiber.com/blog/2021/04/20/infinited-fiber-company-plans-to-build-eur-220-mln-flagship-factory-in-finland/#:~:text=Finnish%20waste%20management%20company%20Lounais,owned%20waste%20management%20companies)[infinitedfiber\.com](https://infinitedfiber.com/blog/2021/04/20/infinited-fiber-company-plans-to-build-eur-220-mln-flagship-factory-in-finland/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20sort%20the%20post,Suomen%20J%C3%A4tehuolto)\. Once IFC’s **30,000 t** plant is running, it will **consume a huge portion of Finland’s textile waste feedstock** \(potentially half of all collected textiles\)\. Although IFC’s output is *cellulose* \(not recycled polyester\), it is arguably the single biggest “competitor” for raw textile feedstock in Finland’s circular economy\. Essentially, IFC and Rester are complementary in function \(one takes cotton, one takes polyester\), but if either needs more input, they might compete over borderline materials or overall supply volume\. For instance, a poly\-cotton shirt could go either route: IFC might take it for the cotton content, or Rester could recycle it mechanically as mixed fiber\. The two have to divvy up what LSJH collects\. In strategic terms, **IFC’s arrival will tighten the market for textile waste feedstock** – it is locking in agreements with LSJH and other sources \(and even planning imports\) to secure raw material[infinitedfiber\.com](https://infinitedfiber.com/blog/2021/04/20/infinited-fiber-company-plans-to-build-eur-220-mln-flagship-factory-in-finland/#:~:text=The%20plant%E2%80%99s%20entire%20output%20is,output%20capacity%20for%20several%20years)[infinitedfiber\.com](https://infinitedfiber.com/blog/2021/04/20/infinited-fiber-company-plans-to-build-eur-220-mln-flagship-factory-in-finland/#:~:text=Finnish%20waste%20management%20company%20Lounais,owned%20waste%20management%20companies)\. From the perspective of a company like FabricAir \(which might want recycled polyester yarn&#x2F;fiber\), IFC means less “easy” availability of domestic waste for polyester recycling, since the cotton gets chemically recycled and the polyester byproduct may not be immediately usable as fiber \(unless recovered by a partner\)\. Thus, while IFC is not sourcing recycled *polyester* per se \(it’s after cellulose\), its large appetite for textile waste makes it a major feedstock rival in Finland’s circular textile ecosystem\.
- **OnceMore by Södra \(Sweden\)** – *Cross\-border partner\.* An honorable mention is the **OnceMore** initiative by Swedish pulp company Södra\. OnceMore uses a process to recycle poly\-cotton blend textiles: the cotton is dissolved into pulp for new viscose fiber, and the polyester is separated\. Södra has partnered with Rester; in fact, Södra’s sourcing manager noted they *“share values and focus with Rester to accelerate circularity”*[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/en/#:~:text=Amaury%20Sartorius%2C%20Managing%20Director%2C%20Klopman)\. Södra has been importing waste textiles from Nordic countries \(including Finland\) to feed its process\. In 2022, Rester sent some of its collected poly\-cotton material to Södra’s OnceMore program[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/en/#:~:text=Amaury%20Sartorius%2C%20Managing%20Director%2C%20Klopman)\. While Södra then returns the polyester fraction back to plastic recyclers, the partnership shows a collaborative rather than competitive angle – Rester can act as a feeder to chemical recyclers\. Still, to the extent Södra&#x2F;OnceMore needs Finnish textile waste, it slightly *competes* with purely domestic uses\. \(However, with IFC coming online, Finnish cotton waste will likely go to IFC, reducing exports to Södra\.\)
- **Other Rester Fiber Buyers:** Rester’s recycled fibers are already being used by a variety of manufacturers, each effectively competing for this new material stream\. Besides Touchpoint \(workwear\) and Klopman \(fabrics\) mentioned earlier, **Vuonue**, a Finnish yarn spinner, has worked with Rester fiber to develop locally\-made recycled yarns[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/en/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)\. **Vileda Professional**, a global cleaning supplies brand, partnered with Rester to turn end\-of\-life textiles into nonwoven cleaning cloths and mops \(a blog on Rester’s site details this case\)\. And in nonwovens, Rester just announced a strategic tie\-up with **The Loop Factory** in Sweden to jointly develop new **nonwoven products from recycled textile fiber**[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/news/a-collaboration-to-revolutionise-textile-recycling/#:~:text=With%20a%20shared%20commitment%20to,fibres%20into%20different%20industrial%20processes)[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/news/a-collaboration-to-revolutionise-textile-recycling/#:~:text=Director%20of%20Partnerships%20at%20Rester)\. The Loop Factory collaboration aims to supply **insulation, acoustic panels, filters, and composites** made from Rester fibers at scale[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/news/a-collaboration-to-revolutionise-textile-recycling/#:~:text=goal%20is%20to%20provide%20the,fibres%20into%20different%20industrial%20processes)[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/news/a-collaboration-to-revolutionise-textile-recycling/#:~:text=Combining%20deep%20knowledge%20in%20building,market%20opportunities%20in%20nonwoven%20materials)\. All these partners – from yarn makers to nonwoven innovators – represent *demand* for recycled fiber that Rester produces\. As Rester increases output, more companies will line up to purchase its Global Recycle Standard \(GRS\) certified fibers[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/news/a-collaboration-to-revolutionise-textile-recycling/#:~:text=We%20are%20building%20global%20and,utilized%20to%20its%20fullest%20potential) as a sustainable alternative to virgin materials\. Each such company is effectively a **competitor for Rester’s feedstock&#x2F;output**, since Rester has finite capacity\. For example, if FabricAir \(a hypothetical user\) wants to buy Rester’s recycled polyester fiber to weave into HVAC textiles, it would be competing with others like a nonwoven insulation maker or a yarn manufacturer who also want that fiber\.

In summary, **Finland’s landscape of recycled polyester usage is rapidly expanding**\. Apparel firms \(Pure Waste, workwear brands, Reima, etc\.\) are incorporating rPET yarns, **driving up demand for recycled polyester fiber**\. Technical sectors \(insulation, acoustic, automotive\) are also adopting recycled PET fiber in place of virgin, from Ewonawool building boards to Intermedius felts and Dafecor mats\. On the supply side, Rester’s new plant \(12 kt\) and LSJH’s collection system have unlocked a large stream of domestically recovered fiber – but **competition for this feedstock is intense**\. Players like Lindström have essentially secured portions of it for closed\-loop use, and the upcoming 30 kt Infinited Fiber plant will absorb a huge share of textile waste \(albeit for cellulose regeneration, not polyester\)\. In effect, any company in Finland \(or nearby\) seeking recycled polyester feedstock – whether as shredded textile fiber or as rPET yarn – will be navigating this dynamic network of textile recyclers and users\. While volumes are still modest compared to total textile consumption, the trajectory is clear: by late 2020s, **tens of thousands of tonnes of Finnish textiles per year will be recycled into new fiber**[knowledge\-hub\.circle\-economy\.com](https://knowledge-hub.circle-economy.com/article/9187#:~:text=Finland%27s%20first%20industrial%20end,transition%20toward%20a%20circular%20economy)[infinitedfiber\.com](https://infinitedfiber.com/blog/2021/04/20/infinited-fiber-company-plans-to-build-eur-220-mln-flagship-factory-in-finland/#:~:text=Infinited%20Fiber%20Company%20currently%20operates,consumer%20textile%20waste%20as%20feedstock)\. Companies positioned now with partnerships \(or investments\) in these recycling streams will have the advantage in securing recycled polyester for their products\. Those “late to the party” may find the **feedstock already cornered by these pioneering firms**\.
