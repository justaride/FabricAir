# Polyester Workwear Standards and Specifications in Finland

Workwear in Finland is subject to international standards \(ISO&#x2F;EN\) for safety, performance, and hygiene, many of which are adopted as **SFS\-EN standards** by the Finnish Standards Association \(SFS\)\. Polyester is a common workwear material due to its durability, quick\-drying, and low\-lint properties\. Below is a comprehensive list of applicable standards and specifications – including general workwear standards, industry\-specific hygiene guidelines, Finnish&#x2F;Nordic certifications, and recycled polyester content standards – along with key material requirements and performance criteria\.

## General Protective Workwear Standards \(EN&#x2F;ISO\)

- **SFS\-EN ISO 13688:2013 – General Requirements for Protective Clothing:** This standard \(which replaced the older EN 340\) defines basic requirements for work clothing ergonomics, innocuousness of materials \(no harmful substances\), size labeling, durability \(e\.g\. seam strength, shrinkage\), and information supplied by the manufacturer[atex\-ammattiasut\.fi](https://www.atex-ammattiasut.fi/standardit#:~:text=European%20standard%20SFS)\. In Finland, EN ISO 13688 is published as SFS\-EN ISO 13688, and it serves as a *reference standard* cited by specific protective clothing standards\. While it does not mandate a particular fabric, it requires that materials be non\-toxic and durable, laying the groundwork for polyester or poly\-cotton workwear to meet **harmlessness and performance** benchmarks[atex\-ammattiasut\.fi](https://www.atex-ammattiasut.fi/standardit#:~:text=European%20standard%20SFS)\.
- **EN ISO 15797:2018 – Industrial Washing and Drying Procedures for Workwear:** Work uniforms in industrial laundry services \(common in Nordic countries\) must withstand rigorous washing\. ISO 15797 specifies standardized test procedures and equipment for evaluating **cotton, polyester\-cotton, and reverse\-blend** workwear fabrics under industrial laundering conditions[cofra\.it](https://www.cofra.it/en/abbigliamento/informative/4#:~:text=EN%20ISO%2015797%20,procedures%20for%20testing%20of%20workwear)\. This ensures that polyester workwear \(often 65&#x2F;35 polyester\-cotton blends or 100% polyester for certain uniforms\) can endure high\-temperature washes and tunnel finishing without significant degradation in color or fabric strength\. Manufacturers use ISO 15797 to prove their garments’ **colorfastness, dimensional stability, and durability** when repeatedly laundered\.
- **EN ISO 20471:2013 – High\-Visibility Clothing:** High\-visibility workwear \(e\.g\. safety vests, jackets\) is typically made of fluorescent polyester fabric with reflective strips\. EN ISO 20471 sets **performance requirements for the background material and retro\-reflective material**, including minimum visible surface areas for three classes of visibility and color chromaticity standards\. For example, Class 3 \(highest visibility\) garments must have at least 0\.80 m² of fluorescent material and 0\.20 m² of reflective tape[atex\-ammattiasut\.fi](https://www.atex-ammattiasut.fi/standardit#:~:text=Protective%20clothing%20according%20to%20EN,visibility%20is%20important%20for%20safety)[atex\-ammattiasut\.fi](https://www.atex-ammattiasut.fi/standardit#:~:text=Minimum%20areas%20of%20fluorescent%20material,reflective%20tape%20in%20different%20categories)\. Polyester is generally used as the base fabric because it can be vividly dyed to meet chromaticity and luminance requirements and is durable against UV exposure\. The standard also requires that hi\-vis materials maintain their brightness and retro\-reflection after specified wash cycles \(simulating wear\), so workwear polyester fabrics are often coated or treated to withstand fading and abrasion\. \(In Finland, EN ISO 20471 is adopted as **SFS\-EN ISO 20471** and is commonly required for road, construction, and industrial workers’ apparel\.\)
- **Other EN Standards for Specialty Workwear:** Depending on the work environment, polyester workwear may need to comply with additional standards\. For instance, **EN 343** for protection against rain \(waterproof&#x2F;breathable coats, often polyester with coatings\) and **EN 342&#x2F;ISO 23387** for cold environments specify material performance in terms of water penetration, thermal insulation, etc\. Polyester outer shells with PU or PVC coatings are used to meet EN 343’s rain protection classes[cofra\.it](https://www.cofra.it/en/abbigliamento/informative/4#:~:text=X%3A%20resistance%20to%20water%20penetration,class%201%20to%204)[cofra\.it](https://www.cofra.it/en/abbigliamento/informative/4#:~:text=water%20penetration%20and%20using%20waterproof,jpg)\. If electrostatic dissipative clothing is required \(e\.g\. in explosive atmospheres or electronics manufacturing\), **EN 1149\-5** is applied – often polyester fabrics with conductive fiber grids are used to satisfy this standard’s requirement for surface resistivity\. All certified protective clothing in Finland will carry the **CE marking** with pictograms denoting the EN standards it complies with[atex\-ammattiasut\.fi](https://www.atex-ammattiasut.fi/standardit#:~:text=protection%20class), and the **SFS\-EN ISO 13688** general requirements standard is implicitly met by all such certified garments[atex\-ammattiasut\.fi](https://www.atex-ammattiasut.fi/standardit#:~:text=All%20our%20certified%20protective%20clothing,separately%20in%20the%20product%20information)\.

## Food Industry Workwear \(HACCP Hygiene Requirements\)

*Example of HACCP\-compliant food industry workwear \(polyester uniforms with no exterior pockets or buttons\)\. Such designs and materials help prevent contamination in food processing environments\.*

 

Workwear used in food processing in Finland must align with food safety hygiene practices, often guided by **HACCP \(Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points\)** principles\. While HACCP itself is a food safety management system and **not a specific fabric standard**, it dictates functional requirements for apparel to minimize contamination risks\. Key specifications for HACCP\-compliant uniforms include:

- **No Pockets Above the Waist:** Garments like coats or smocks should not have breast pockets, as these can trap contaminants or items that might fall into food[directtextilestore\.com](https://directtextilestore.com/blog/what-are-haccp-uniforms?srsltid=AfmBOoo66ZIRdzYkMeC10ydkSl8XUNPENFx1TsKd4RevBFNsqPHuUjCI#:~:text=No%20pockets%20above%20the%20waist,into%20the%20food%20or%20packaging)\. This is mandated to prevent foreign objects or bacteria carried in personal items from contaminating food\.
- **No Buttons or Loose Parts:** Traditional buttons are avoided because they can harbor bacteria and might detach into product\. Instead, food\-industry workwear uses snap closures, Velcro, or wrap\-around tie designs with concealed fastenings[directtextilestore\.com](https://directtextilestore.com/blog/what-are-haccp-uniforms?srsltid=AfmBOoo66ZIRdzYkMeC10ydkSl8XUNPENFx1TsKd4RevBFNsqPHuUjCI#:~:text=No%20buttons%20%E2%80%94%20What%E2%80%99s%20wrong,used%20in%20food%20processing%20uniforms)\. This eliminates physical hazards \(e\.g\. a button in food\) and allows garments to withstand high\-frequency laundering without hardware failure\.
- **Durable, Low\-Lint Fabric \(Preferably Polyester\):** To maintain hygiene, workwear must be washed frequently \(often daily\)\. Fabrics should be **industrial\-grade and low\-shedding** so they do not contaminate food with fibers\. Research indicates that **100% spun\-polyester garments** provide higher levels of microbial cleanliness compared to cotton, and they hold up to repeated hot washes without breaking down[directtextilestore\.com](https://directtextilestore.com/blog/what-are-haccp-uniforms?srsltid=AfmBOoo66ZIRdzYkMeC10ydkSl8XUNPENFx1TsKd4RevBFNsqPHuUjCI#:~:text=washings,protection%20as%20compared%20with%20cotton)\. Polyester’s smooth fibers release soil easily and don’t harbor bacteria as much as natural fibers\. For this reason, Finnish food\-processing uniforms \(e\.g\. meat, dairy, bakery sectors\) are commonly made of polyester or polycotton with a high polyester content\. The Finnish Food Authority recommends choosing workwear materials that are *“easy to keep clean and durable”* given the intended use and washing methods[ruokavirasto\.fi](https://www.ruokavirasto.fi/en/foodstuffs/food-sector/hygienic-actions/personnel/work-clothes/#:~:text=The%20work%20clothes%20and%20protective,being%20distinguished%20on%20the%20clothing)\.
- **Light Color and Design:** Although not a performance standard per se, white or light\-colored uniforms are customary in food industries \(as noted by HACCP guidelines\) because they show dirt&#x2F;stains easily, prompting timely changes[directtextilestore\.com](https://directtextilestore.com/blog/what-are-haccp-uniforms?srsltid=AfmBOoo66ZIRdzYkMeC10ydkSl8XUNPENFx1TsKd4RevBFNsqPHuUjCI#:~:text=HACCP%20uniforms%20are%20food%20processing,gloves%2C%20and%20a%20face%20mask)\. Finnish regulations require work clothes to be changed often enough to remain clean[ruokavirasto\.fi](https://www.ruokavirasto.fi/en/foodstuffs/food-sector/hygienic-actions/personnel/work-clothes/#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20work%20clothes,must%20be%20worn%20when%20necessary)[ruokavirasto\.fi](https://www.ruokavirasto.fi/en/foodstuffs/food-sector/hygienic-actions/personnel/work-clothes/#:~:text=The%20work%20clothes%20and%20protective,being%20distinguished%20on%20the%20clothing), and having a design that makes soil visible is part of this practice\. Garments typically include complementary protective items like hairnets, beard covers, disposable gloves, and aprons to fully contain contaminants[directtextilestore\.com](https://directtextilestore.com/blog/what-are-haccp-uniforms?srsltid=AfmBOoo66ZIRdzYkMeC10ydkSl8XUNPENFx1TsKd4RevBFNsqPHuUjCI#:~:text=HACCP%20uniforms%20are%20food%20processing,gloves%2C%20and%20a%20face%20mask)\.

In Germany and some EU contexts, a specific standard **DIN 10524:2012** exists, which details hygiene workwear requirements for food processing\. DIN 10524 classifies food\-workwear into three risk categories \(1: low risk, up to 3: very high risk\) and specifies design, function, and fabric criteria for each[bp\-online\.com](https://www.bp-online.com/en-gb/haccp-clothing/#:~:text=More%20safety%20for%20the%20pharmaceutical,and%20food%20industry)\. For example, at higher risk levels \(handling open, perishable foods that won’t be cooked further\), workwear must provide a *“very high protective function”* – meaning more coverage \(e\.g\. coverall instead of coat\), more frequent changes \(at least daily\), and stricter material lint\-free quality[bp\-online\.com](https://www.bp-online.com/en-gb/haccp-clothing/topics/din-10524/#:~:text=%23%20%20DIN%2010524%20,risk%20protection%20class%203)\. While Finland doesn’t have a separate national standard identical to DIN 10524, Finnish food companies often adhere to similar principles \(and some may voluntarily follow DIN 10524 as a best practice\) to ensure compliance with EU food hygiene regulation **852&#x2F;2004**\. In practice, this means Finnish food industry work garments are designed much like those elsewhere in Europe: minimal pockets&#x2F;seams, robust polyester fabrics, and compatibility with hygienic laundering\.

- **EN 14065 – Laundry Hygiene \(RABC Process\):** A crucial aspect of workwear hygiene is how garments are washed and handled\. Many Finnish laundries and rental workwear services \(e\.g\. Lindström\) are certified to **EN 14065**[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/services/food/#:~:text=Ensure%20the%20hygiene%20of%20workwear,and%20production)\. EN 14065 is a European standard for **Risk Analysis and Biocontamination Control \(RABC\)** in laundries, ensuring that textiles \(like food industry uniforms or hospital linens\) are laundered to a microbiologically safe standard\. Compliance with EN 14065 means the provider has documented processes to achieve defined bacterial cleanliness levels on clothing\. For end\-users, this standard guarantees that the polyester coats and pants returned from the laundry are **hygienically clean \(e\.g\. &lt;50 CFU&#x2F;dm² bioburden\)**[food\-safety\.com](https://www.food-safety.com/ext/resources/Files/Cintas-Food-Processing-Apparel,-x-1839-rev-1220,-Digital-(1).pdf#:~:text=sends%20textiles%20to%20a%20certified,4) and safe for direct contact with food environments\. Finnish food\-sector workwear programs combine HACCP garment design with EN 14065\-controlled washing to maintain consistent hygiene throughout the garment’s use cycle[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/services/food/#:~:text=Ensure%20the%20hygiene%20of%20workwear,and%20production)\.

## Cleanroom and ESD Garment Standards

Cleanrooms \(used in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, electronics, etc\.\) require special polyester apparel to control particulate contamination\. Finland follows international cleanroom standards, primarily the ISO 14644 series, for classifying cleanroom environments and appropriate gowning\.

- **ISO 14644\-1 Cleanroom Classes:** This standard classifies cleanrooms by airborne particle count, from ISO Class 1 \(ultra\-clean\) to ISO Class 9 \(least clean\)[cintas\.com](https://www.cintas.com/newsroom/details/news/2025/09/17/understanding-the-different-cleanroom-classifications-and-their-gowning-needs/#:~:text=science%20governed%20by%20two%20main,systems%20worldwide)\. The required clothing depends on the cleanliness class and whether the cleanroom is *aseptic* \(also controlling microbes\) or just particle\-controlled\. Polyester is the material of choice for reusable cleanroom garments because it generates very low lint\. For example, in an **ISO Class 7 \(FED Class 10,000\) cleanroom**, personnel are typically required to wear a **full\-body cleanroom suit&#x2F;coverall made from a lint‐free polyester woven fabric**, along with hood, dedicated shoes or boot covers, and gloves[cintas\.com](https://www.cintas.com/newsroom/details/news/2025/09/17/understanding-the-different-cleanroom-classifications-and-their-gowning-needs/#:~:text=,may%20be%20used%20in%20conjunction)\. This ensemble ensures minimal particle shedding\. The fabric is often a filament polyester with a tight weave \(and sometimes carbon fiber grid for static dissipation\), which prevents fiber breakage\. Higher classes \(ISO Class 5 or Class 4, used for sterile pharmaceutical production or semiconductor fabrication\) demand even more stringent gowning: multilayer or sterilizable polyester suits, and sometimes **air\-fed suits** for Class 1–3[cintas\.com](https://www.cintas.com/newsroom/details/news/2025/09/17/understanding-the-different-cleanroom-classifications-and-their-gowning-needs/#:~:text=,exhaled%20particles%20and%20protect%20eyes)[cintas\.com](https://www.cintas.com/newsroom/details/news/2025/09/17/understanding-the-different-cleanroom-classifications-and-their-gowning-needs/#:~:text=ISO%20Class%204%2C%203%2C%202%2C,and%201)\.
- **IEST and CEN Cleanroom Garment Specs:** While ISO 14644 defines the environment, additional guidelines cover garment performance\. The **IEST\-RP\-CC003** recommended practice \(from the Institute of Environmental Sciences and Technology\) is often referenced globally for cleanroom fabrics – it categorizes materials by particle shedding via tests like the Helmke Drum\. Reusable cleanroom coveralls made of 100% polyester are rated as **Category I \(lowest shedding\)** under such tests, meaning they can be used even in ISO Class 3–5 rooms \(with proper laundering\)[shop\.valutek\.com](https://shop.valutek.com/products/valutek-launderable-esd-cleanroom-coverall?variant=41090996273227#:~:text=Valutek%20Launderable%20Polyester%20Cleanroom%20Coverall,Category%201%20garments%20when)[encompasscleanrooms\.com](https://encompasscleanrooms.com/blog/cleanroom-gowning-procedures-garment-standards#:~:text=Cleanroom%20Gowning%20Procedures%20%26%20Garment,Tyvek%C2%AE%20to%20minimize%20particle%20generation)\. European cleanroom laundries also follow **CEN TR 16238** and **EN 17141:2020** for biocontamination control in cleanrooms, ensuring garments are sterilized or disinfected appropriately\. In Finland, companies in microelectronics or pharma often rent cleanroom garment services that provide **ISO class–certified polyester attire** and laundering in ISO 14644\-5 compliant facilities\. The key material specification is a **microfilament polyester** \(sometimes with an conductive fiber grid\) that is non\-linting, autoclavable if required, and maintains electrostatic dissipation per **EN 61340\-5\-1** \(for ESD control in electronics manufacturing\)\. These garments are typically white or blue, and designs avoid pockets or folds that could trap particles – similar to food HACCP garments but with even more emphasis on particle filtration of the fabric\.

## Finnish&#x2F;Nordic Certifications and Eco\-Standards

In addition to safety and hygiene standards, Finland and other Nordic countries emphasize environmental and quality certifications for textiles:

- **SFS Standards \(Finnish National Adoptions\):** Finland’s national standards body, SFS, adopts European and ISO standards, meaning that most EN ISO workwear standards are available as **SFS\-EN ISO** versions \(identical in content\)\. For example, general workwear requirements are published as **SFS\-EN ISO 13688**[atex\-ammattiasut\.fi](https://www.atex-ammattiasut.fi/standardit#:~:text=The%20general%20requirements%20for%20protective,EN%20340) and high\-visibility clothing as SFS\-EN ISO 20471, etc\. There are also SFS guidelines for specific textiles \(e\.g\., an SFS specification for uniforms made of wool&#x2F;wool\-blend exists[sales\.sfs\.fi](https://sales.sfs.fi/en/index/tuoteryhmahaku.html.stx?pg=59.080.30&g=BSI#:~:text=Fabrics%20for%20uniforms%20and%20workwear,248)\), but by and large, Finnish workwear must meet the *harmonized EN standards* to be legally sold for protective use\. Certification and testing in Finland is often done by bodies like SGS Fimko or Eurofins, who ensure the materials \(be it polyester, cotton, or blends\) meet all required EN ISO test criteria \(tear strength, seam strength, colorfastness, etc\.\) for the given standard\. In summary, **there are no unique “Finnish\-only” workwear material standards** – the country relies on the European framework, augmented by industry\-specific best practices \(like those from the Finnish Food Authority for hygiene[ruokavirasto\.fi](https://www.ruokavirasto.fi/en/foodstuffs/food-sector/hygienic-actions/personnel/work-clothes/#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20work%20clothes,must%20be%20worn%20when%20necessary)[ruokavirasto\.fi](https://www.ruokavirasto.fi/en/foodstuffs/food-sector/hygienic-actions/personnel/work-clothes/#:~:text=The%20work%20clothes%20and%20protective,being%20distinguished%20on%20the%20clothing)\)\.
- **Nordic Swan Ecolabel \(Textile Criteria\):** The Nordic countries \(including Finland\) have a voluntary ecolabeling system known as the **Nordic Swan**\. Workwear and textiles can be Swan\-certified if they meet stringent environmental criteria spanning the product’s lifecycle\. For polyester \(a fossil\-based synthetic fiber\), the **Nordic Swan sets strict material composition requirements to promote sustainability**\. Notably, the latest Textile criteria \(version 5\.8, 2025\) require that any **polyester or other fossil synthetic in an ecolabeled garment must be 100% recycled** content \(with very limited exceptions\)[nordic\-swan\-ecolabel\.org](https://www.nordic-swan-ecolabel.org/4aa747/contentassets/2a4b1e9ce1d04ad0a820553f8b716cd9/criteria-document_039_manufacturing-of-textiles-hidesskins-and-leather-039_english.pdf#:~:text=Synthetic%20fibre%20of%20fossil%20origin,approved%20as%20food)\. This is an ambitious requirement aimed at reducing virgin plastic use\. It means that a polyester work jacket or trouser carrying the Swan mark would need to be made entirely from post\-consumer or post\-industrial recycled fibers\. The only exceptions are up to 10% elastane or similar needed for functional stretch, and even that elastane must be Oeko\-Tex 100 certified for safety[nordic\-swan\-ecolabel\.org](https://www.nordic-swan-ecolabel.org/4aa747/contentassets/2a4b1e9ce1d04ad0a820553f8b716cd9/criteria-document_039_manufacturing-of-textiles-hidesskins-and-leather-039_english.pdf#:~:text=contact%20material%20or%20marketed%20as,recycled%2C%20or%20other%20equivalent%20certification)\. The Nordic Swan also bans certain harmful chemicals \(like PFAS water\-repellents, flame retardants, azo dyes, etc\.\) and requires robust quality \(longevity\) so that workwear lasts longer – indirectly favoring polyester for its durability and washable nature\. **Certification and Traceability:** To verify the recycled content, the Swan criteria accept third\-party chain\-of\-custody certifications such as the **Global Recycled Standard \(GRS\)** or **Recycled Claim Standard \(RCS\)** as documentation[nordic\-swan\-ecolabel\.org](https://www.nordic-swan-ecolabel.org/4aa747/contentassets/2a4b1e9ce1d04ad0a820553f8b716cd9/criteria-document_039_manufacturing-of-textiles-hidesskins-and-leather-039_english.pdf#:~:text=below%3A%20a,material%20and%20documenting%20that%20the)\. Manufacturers must provide a certificate \(e\.g\., GRS\) proving the polyester fiber in the garment is recycled and traceable back through the supply chain\. In Finland, many workwear providers are pursuing the Swan label to meet public procurement demands for eco\-friendly textiles\. For example, a Swan\-labeled work coat might use 100% recycled PET polyester fabric, with sewing threads and even insulation \(if any\) also recycled, and the product would have to pass tests for quality \(color fastness, shrinkage\) to ensure recyclability doesn’t come at the cost of performance\.
- **OEKO\-TEX® Standard 100 and REACH:** While not Finland\-specific, most polyester workwear in Europe is **OEKO\-TEX Standard 100** certified to be free from harmful substances\. This is often a baseline requirement for any next\-to\-skin clothing, including work T\-shirts, polos, and coveralls\. It ensures things like formaldehyde, heavy metals, or banned amines from dyes are not present above safe thresholds\. Additionally, EU **REACH** regulations restrict dangerous chemicals in textiles; for instance, certain flame\-retardant additives and perfluorinated repellents are restricted\. Finnish companies closely adhere to these regulations – for instance, Lindström \(a major Finnish workwear supplier\) only uses REACH\-compliant dyes and finishes, and often touts OEKO\-TEX certified fabrics for their uniforms\. Though these are not “standards” in the traditional sense, they form part of the **material specifications** that any reputable workwear in Finland will meet: the polyester fabric not only needs to perform physically but also be chemically safe and regulatory\-compliant\.

## Recycled Polyester Content Standards and Traceability

Sustainability standards are increasingly important for workwear materials\. Polyester, being petroleum\-based, is a focus of recycling initiatives\. Several global standards ensure recycled polyester content claims are genuine and traceable:

- **Global Recycled Standard \(GRS\):** The GRS is an international, voluntary standard that verifies recycled material content in a product and checks responsible processing\. For a workwear garment \(or any textile product\) to be **GRS\-certified**, it must contain at least **20% recycled material**; however, to carry the GRS consumer\-facing logo, it must have **≥50% recycled content**[recoverfiber\.com](https://recoverfiber.com/newsroom/what-is-grs#:~:text=Products%20must%20include%20a%20minimum,labeled%20with%20the%20GRS%20logo)\. In practice, most GRS\-certified workwear fabrics aim for that 50% or higher recycled polyester\. The GRS also encompasses social and environmental criteria: certified factories must meet wastewater treatment standards, no toxic chemicals from a restricted list can be used on the GRS product, and workers’ rights are audited[textileexchange\.org](https://textileexchange.org/recycled-claim-global-recycled-standard/#:~:text=The%20Recycled%20Claim%20Standard%20,to%20processing%20and%20chemical%20use)[textileexchange\.org](https://textileexchange.org/recycled-claim-global-recycled-standard/#:~:text=,of%20recycled%20content%20in%20products)\. GRS provides **chain\-of\-custody tracking**: each stage of the supply chain is audited by approved certifiers, and transactions of recycled fiber, yarn, fabric, and final garment are documented via **Scope Certificates and Transaction Certificates**[recoverfiber\.com](https://recoverfiber.com/newsroom/what-is-grs#:~:text=Global%20Recycling%20Content%20certifications%20are,SCs)[recoverfiber\.com](https://recoverfiber.com/newsroom/what-is-grs#:~:text=To%20summarize%2C%20a%20TC%20is,the%20company%2C%20as%20illustrated%20below)\. This ensures that, for example, a Finnish workwear brand sourcing GRS\-certified recycled polyester fabric can trace that fabric back to recycled PET flake or yarn and prove the content claim\. In summary, a **GRS 4\.0** certified polyester overall means the overall is made of at least 50% recycled fibers, and was produced in an environmentally and socially responsible manner[textileexchange\.org](https://textileexchange.org/recycled-claim-global-recycled-standard/#:~:text=The%20Recycled%20Claim%20Standard%20,to%20processing%20and%20chemical%20use)\.
- **Recycled Claim Standard \(RCS\):** Also developed by Textile Exchange, the RCS is a simpler chain\-of\-custody standard that **verifies the percentage of recycled content** in a product but **does not impose additional environmental&#x2F;social requirements**\. There is no minimum recycled content required for RCS – a product can be RCS\-certified even if it has, say, 5% recycled polyester, but the exact percentage will be stated\. The RCS is often used for business\-to\-business assurance when a brand wants to label a specific recycled content percentage\. In Finland, if a workwear item has a smaller fraction of recycled material \(below GRS’s 50% logo threshold\), companies might use RCS to still verify and claim that content\. Both RCS and GRS use the same definitions of “recycled” aligned with ISO 14021 \(distinguishing pre\-consumer vs\. post\-consumer waste\)[nordic\-swan\-ecolabel\.org](https://www.nordic-swan-ecolabel.org/4aa747/contentassets/2a4b1e9ce1d04ad0a820553f8b716cd9/criteria-document_039_manufacturing-of-textiles-hidesskins-and-leather-039_english.pdf#:~:text=,Chemical%20recycling)\. The main difference is RCS is content\-only, whereas GRS is more comprehensive\. Notably, the **Nordic Swan** criteria recognized these: they allow either GRS or RCS certification as proof of recycled polyester in a product[nordic\-swan\-ecolabel\.org](https://www.nordic-swan-ecolabel.org/4aa747/contentassets/2a4b1e9ce1d04ad0a820553f8b716cd9/criteria-document_039_manufacturing-of-textiles-hidesskins-and-leather-039_english.pdf#:~:text=below%3A%20a,material%20and%20documenting%20that%20the), but since Swan demands 100% recycled synthetics, most Swan applicants opt for GRS for its stricter oversight\.
- **Traceability and EU Regulations:** Traceability of recycled polyester is becoming part of regulatory frameworks as well\. The upcoming EU **Textile Strategy** and proposed legislation will likely mandate clearer labeling of recycled content\. Already, **ISO 22095 \(Chain of Custody\)** provides general guidance for tracking material through the supply chain, and specific to plastics recycling, the EU has regulation \(EC\) No\. 2019&#x2F;665 for recycled plastic in food\-contact materials – which, by analogy, influences how textiles from food\-contact recycled plastics are viewed \(Nordic Swan explicitly disallows recycled PET from food\-contact sources for safety[nordic\-swan\-ecolabel\.org](https://www.nordic-swan-ecolabel.org/4aa747/contentassets/2a4b1e9ce1d04ad0a820553f8b716cd9/criteria-document_039_manufacturing-of-textiles-hidesskins-and-leather-039_english.pdf#:~:text=Synthetic%20fibre%20of%20fossil%20origin,time%20comply%20with%20requirement%20O30)[nordic\-swan\-ecolabel\.org](https://www.nordic-swan-ecolabel.org/4aa747/contentassets/2a4b1e9ce1d04ad0a820553f8b716cd9/criteria-document_039_manufacturing-of-textiles-hidesskins-and-leather-039_english.pdf#:~:text=below%3A%20a,material%20and%20documenting%20that%20the)\)\. Finnish workwear manufacturers working with recycled polyester navigate these requirements by ensuring their recycled fiber comes with the proper certifications and documentation\. In practical terms, when specifying **material for polyester workwear in Finland today, it is often required to state the recycled content and have it certified**\. Many public tenders for uniforms now ask for a certain percentage of recycled fiber – e\.g\., “fabric must contain minimum 50% recycled polyester, certified to GRS or equivalent\.” Thus, compliance with GRS&#x2F;RCS has become part of the material specification for polyester workwear, alongside the traditional performance standards\.

## Conclusion

In Finland, polyester workwear must meet a combination of **safety standards \(EN ISO\)**, **hygienic design requirements \(HACCP, industry guidelines\)**, and increasingly, **sustainability standards**\. The material specifications for such workwear typically call for high\-quality polyester \(often recycled\), which can pass stringent tests for durability \(industrial laundry, abrasion, etc\.\), while also being safe \(free of hazardous substances\) and appropriate for the intended environment \(low\-lint for cleanrooms&#x2F;food areas, high\-visibility for roadwork, etc\.\)\. By complying with standards like SFS\-EN ISO 13688 for general quality, EN 14065 for hygiene, and GRS for recycled content, Finnish workwear manufacturers and suppliers ensure that their polyester uniforms protect workers effectively, maintain food&#x2F;pharma safety, and align with the country’s eco\-conscious values\.
