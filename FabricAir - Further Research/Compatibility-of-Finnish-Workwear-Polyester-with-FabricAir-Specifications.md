# Compatibility of Finnish Workwear Polyester with FabricAir Specifications

## FabricAir Textile Requirements

**FabricAir Duct Fabric Specs:** FabricAir’s fabric ducts are made from **100% polyester \(PET\)** and weigh around **300 g&#x2F;m²**, designed as heavy\-duty textiles[fabricairsa\.co\.za](https://www.fabricairsa.co.za/why-use-fabric.html#:~:text=The%20hygienic%20alternative%20to%20metal,it%20can%20simply%20be%20washed)[fabricairsa\.co\.za](https://www.fabricairsa.co.za/why-use-fabric.html#:~:text=Lightweight%20design%20for%20heavy%20duty,comparison%20to%20conventional%20metal%20systems)\. The material is typically a **coarse fiber weave** for durability and is often only produced in **white** \(e\.g\. “FabricAir Poly” is available in white only\)[abtehnic\.eu](https://abtehnic.eu/dispersion-systems-textile-ducts/fabricair-poly/#:~:text=)\. These attributes ensure the ducts are strong, washable, and hygienic \(polyester doesn’t absorb water or harbor bacteria\)[fabricairsa\.co\.za](https://www.fabricairsa.co.za/why-use-fabric.html#:~:text=The%20hygienic%20alternative%20to%20metal,it%20can%20simply%20be%20washed)\. In summary, FabricAir needs a *pure PET fiber*, relatively **heavy fabric weight \(~300 gsm\)**, **thick&#x2F;coarse yarn** construction, and preferably **light\-colored \(white\)** input to meet performance and color requirements\.

## Finnish Workwear Material Characteristics

**Composition:** Finnish industrial workwear \(as supplied by companies like Lindström\) is most commonly a **polyester–cotton blend** fabric\. A classic example is a 65% polyester &#x2F; 35% cotton twill, which is prized for durability and comfort[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/top-safety-features-of-workwear-in-automotive-industry/#:~:text=65%20PES%2F%2035%20CO)\. In fact, *“most of \[Lindström’s\] garments are made from polyester\-cotton blends”*[d2ris6qfzcz0wn\.cloudfront\.net](https://d2ris6qfzcz0wn.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2025/03/Lindstrom-Sustainability-Brochure-2024-web.pdf#:~:text=The%20new%20fabric%20contains%2010,raw%20materials%20for%20the%20pro%02cess)\. Pure 100% polyester garments exist in certain categories \(for instance, fleece jackets at ~250 g&#x2F;m² are 100% PET[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/sk/priemyselne-odvetvia/pracovne-odevy-pre-automobilovy-a-montazny-priemysel-a-strojarstvo/#:~:text=dlhodob%C3%BA%20pru%C5%BEnos%C5%A5), and high\-visibility safety vests or rainwear are often polyester\), but a large fraction of Finnish work uniforms incorporate cotton\.

 

**Fabric Weight:** Typical workwear fabric weights range from mid\-weight to heavy\. A common poly\-cotton workwear twill is around **245 g&#x2F;m²**, considered mid\-to\-heavy for demanding use[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/top-safety-features-of-workwear-in-automotive-industry/#:~:text=245)\. Some specialized workwear textiles do reach the **300 g&#x2F;m²** range – for example, Lindström’s “sweater knit” workwear fabrics are listed at **290–300 g&#x2F;m²** \(in blends like 65&#x2F;35 or 50&#x2F;50 PES&#x2F;CO\)[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/sk/priemyselne-odvetvia/pracovne-odevy-pre-automobilovy-a-montazny-priemysel-a-strojarstvo/#:~:text=65%20PES%20%2F%2035%20CO%2C,50%20CO%2C%20300%20g)\. Thus, certain Finnish workwear items \(like heavy knit jackets or insulated coveralls\) approach FabricAir’s ~300 g&#x2F;m² requirement, whereas standard uniforms \(jackets, trousers\) are often slightly lighter \(~200–270 gsm\)\.

 

**Fiber Coarseness:** Workwear fabrics prioritize strength and longevity, often using **coarser, thicker yarns** and lower thread counts to withstand wear\. The polyester fibers in these textiles are not “microfiber” fine, but rather standard denier staple fibers blended with cotton to make robust yarn[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/top-safety-features-of-workwear-in-automotive-industry/#:~:text=65%20PES%2F%2035%20CO)\. When these garments are mechanically recycled, the fibers that result are **shorter and more irregular** \(a natural outcome of tearing&#x2F;shredding\)\. Spinning such recycled fibers into yarn is feasible mostly for **coarse \(heavy count\) yarns**, not fine yarns[cikis\.studio](https://www.cikis.studio/en/article/interview-with-recover-the-mechanical-recycling-of-textile-fibers#:~:text=Recycled%20fibers%20with%20elastane%20content,products%2C%20elastane%20should%20be%20avoided)\. In other words, recycled workwear fibers can produce thick, heavy threads \(compatible with FabricAir’s coarse fiber needs\), but would struggle to make very fine threads\. This inherent coarseness can actually be an advantage: FabricAir’s heavy fabric doesn’t require fine yarn, and coarse recycled fiber may still meet the strength requirements if processed properly\.

## Mechanical Recycling Compatibility

**Polyester Content and Separation:** Mechanical recycling \(as done by Finnish recycler Rester, for example\) cannot separate blended fibers into pure components[lampoonmagazine\.com](https://lampoonmagazine.com/rester-recovery-fiber-plant-finland/#:~:text=The%20quality%20and%20the%20consistency,cotton%20out%20of%20polycotton%C2%BB)\. If a poly\-cotton garment is shredded, the output fiber will also be a **polyester&#x2F;cotton mix**\. This is a critical compatibility issue: FabricAir demands 100% PET, but Finnish workwear waste is often a PET&#x2F;Cotton mix\. **Without additional processing, a mixed\-fiber recycled output will not meet a “100% polyester” specification\.** To obtain pure PET fiber, the input to the recycler must be sorted to exclude cotton or any other fiber\. Finnish sources indicate that workwear streams can be sorted by material – Rester handles **pure polyester streams** separately from poly\-cotton ones[lampoonmagazine\.com](https://lampoonmagazine.com/rester-recovery-fiber-plant-finland/#:~:text=The%20quality%20and%20the%20consistency,cotton%20out%20of%20polycotton%C2%BB)\. Therefore, only **polyester\-rich uniforms** \(or the polyester portion of blends if somehow isolated\) are compatible feedstock\. In practice, achieving a clean 100% PET recycled fiber from Finnish workwear requires **pre\-sorting** to pick out garments that are entirely or predominantly polyester\. Blended uniforms would produce a fiber that doesn’t match FabricAir’s material requirement unless a chemical separation process is used \(which is currently beyond mechanical recycling capabilities\)\.

 

**Fiber Quality and Strength:** Mechanical recycling inevitably shortens fiber length and can damage fiber strength[diva\-portal\.org](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1924705/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=Mechanical%20recycling%20reduces%20fiber%20length,Sample%20shape%20and)\. However, FabricAir’s application \(ventilation ducts\) can likely tolerate a coarser yarn made from shorter fibers, as long as the yarn is strong enough\. To compensate for shorter recycled fibers, often **virgin fibers are blended in or yarns are spun thicker**[cikis\.studio](https://www.cikis.studio/en/article/interview-with-recover-the-mechanical-recycling-of-textile-fibers#:~:text=Recycled%20fibers%20with%20elastane%20content,products%2C%20elastane%20should%20be%20avoided)\. FabricAir fabrics being ~300 gsm and coarse implies the yarns are relatively heavy count, which is actually suitable for a high proportion of recycled fiber\. In other words, the **coarse fabric specification is an encouraging sign** – it means the product doesn’t require fine, long\-staple fibers\. As long as the recycled fiber is 100% PET and reasonably strong, it could be spun \(perhaps with some virgin reinforcement\) into a heavy yarn for FabricAir ducts\. Finnish workwear that was originally high\-quality and durable \(with coarse fibers\) provides a good raw material base; after recycling, the fibers are shorter but still usable for heavy textiles\.

 

**Color Sorting:** FabricAir prefers white or undyed material because it’s easier to achieve the desired final color \(many FabricAir ducts are white, and white base fiber can be dyed or left neutral\)\. Finnish workwear comes in various colors \(navy blue, gray, hi\-vis neon, etc\.\), and **most are not white**\. This means that to use recycled fiber in a *white FabricAir fabric*, the input textiles should be light\-colored or white\. Mechanical recycling of mixed colors yields a gray or muddled fiber output that is hard to turn white\. Finnish textile recyclers address this by sorting feedstocks by color shade \(e\.g\., “light tone” vs “dark tone” batches\)[rester\.fi](https://rester.fi/en/#:~:text=material%20%E2%80%93%20textile%20to%20textile,wool%2C%20polypropylene%2C%20and%20mixed%20materials)\. For compatibility, **white lab coats, white hospital textiles, or very light\-colored workwear** would be the preferred input to get a near\-white recycled PET fiber\. If only dark\-colored workwear is available, the fiber might need chemical bleaching \(which is costly and can weaken fibers\) or it would only be suitable for a colored FabricAir product\. Notably, *FabricAir Poly* being “white only” means any recycled fiber used for that product must come from white sources[abtehnic\.eu](https://abtehnic.eu/dispersion-systems-textile-ducts/fabricair-poly/#:~:text=)\. In summary, there is partial compatibility on color: **it exists, but requires careful sorting** of Finnish workwear to gather a light&#x2F;white polyester feedstock\.

## Coatings and Finish Treatments Considerations

Finnish workwear often includes various chemical treatments that could affect recycling and compatibility:

- **Flame\-Retardant \(FR\) Finishes:** Certain workwear \(e\.g\. for welders, electricians\) is treated with durable flame\-retardant chemicals \(often phosphorus\-based on cotton fabrics, or special fibers like modacrylic in blends\)[blog\.tarasafe\.comblog\.tarasafe\.com](https://blog.tarasafe.com/2022/04/25/disposal-fr-clothing/#:~:text=Protective%20clothing%20segment%2C%20majorly%20produced,like%20aramids%2C%20polyamides%2C%20modacrylics%2C%20etc)\. If FR\-treated garments are mechanically recycled, those chemicals remain in the fiber\. This poses two issues: **processing safety and output consistency**\. FR\-treated textiles can produce hazardous dust or require careful handling during shredding[blog\.tarasafe\.com](https://blog.tarasafe.com/2022/04/25/disposal-fr-clothing/#:~:text=Mechanical%20recycling%20of%20the%20textile,slightly%20inferior%20quality%20of%20product)\. Moreover, a mix of FR\-treated and non\-treated fibers in the recycled output could lead to inconsistent flame resistance in the new fabric\. FabricAir ducts \(especially for public buildings\) usually need to be flame retardant, but that is achieved in a controlled way \(either using FR polyester or applying a treatment to the finished fabric\)\. Relying on residual FR chemicals from workwear is risky because the concentration and effectiveness will vary\. **Compatibility outlook:** FR workwear can be recycled, but recyclers note it’s challenging and not widely done today[blog\.tarasafe\.com](https://blog.tarasafe.com/2022/04/25/disposal-fr-clothing/#:~:text=Mechanical%20recycling%20of%20the%20textile,slightly%20inferior%20quality%20of%20product)\. For FabricAir’s purposes, it may be better to **exclude** heavily FR\-coated garments from the feed, and instead apply a known flame\-retardant finish to the new FabricAir duct fabric\. Unpredictable remnants of old FR chemicals could interfere with new finishing or cause the recycled fiber to behave differently \(e\.g\., affect dye uptake or require different processing\)\. In short, **FR treatments in input material are a red flag** – they don’t prevent recycling, but they complicate it\.
- **Polyurethane Coatings and Laminates:** Some workwear \(rainwear, waterproof jackets, hi\-vis raincoats\) use PU coatings or laminates on polyester for waterproofing\. Mechanically recycling such coated textiles is problematic\. The coating is essentially a layer of plastic on the fiber that **does not tear into spinnable fiber**\. It tends to either **contaminate the fiber with flakes of coating** or gum up the machinery\. *Separating a PU coating from the base polyester is very tricky in recycling*[textileexchange\.org](https://textileexchange.org/other-synthetics/#:~:text=Virgin%20synthetics%20are%20made%20from,Though%20acrylic%20can%20be%20recycled) – it usually requires chemical processes\. For mechanical recycling, it’s often necessary to **remove coated sections** or avoid them\. From a compatibility standpoint, **PU\-coated workwear should be kept out of the recycling feed** destined for FabricAir fibers\. If small amounts of PU remain, the recycled fiber might have bits of coating that reduce fiber quality and spinnability\. FabricAir fabrics need to be uniform and breathable or permeable as designed; any residual coating could block permeability or weaken the yarn\. Thus, **garments with heavy coatings \(PU or PVC\) are not very compatible** with producing high\-quality recycled PET fiber\.
- **Antimicrobial or Other Finishes:** Some workwear, particularly in healthcare, might have anti\-odor&#x2F;antimicrobial treatments \(such as silver ion imbued fibers or antibacterial finishes\)\. These are generally in small quantities\. They don’t impede mechanical recycling like a coating would, but they do become part of the recycled fiber’s chemical makeup\. In most cases, the leftover antimicrobial agents are dilute and may not significantly affect the new fabric’s performance \(they might even be completely washed out during the textile’s life\)\. The main consideration is that any **chemical finishes \(stain repellents, anti\-static carbon fibers, etc\.\)** present in the input could slightly alter the properties of the recycled fiber\. For example, **anti\-static fibers \(carbon or metal threads\)** in uniforms would end up in the fiber mix\. While these small fractions likely won’t ruin the recycled PET fiber, they could affect quality if present in large amount\. The safest approach is to **sort out workwear with specialized functional finishes** when high\-purity output is needed\. FabricAir does offer anti\-microbial or anti\-static duct fabrics as product options, but those are achieved via specific additives in manufacturing, not randomly from recycled content[fabricair\.com](https://www.fabricair.com/us/products/fabric-air-ducts/fabrics/combi-30/#:~:text=Combi%2030%20,5%20year%20warranty%3B%20Flame)[fabricair\.com](https://www.fabricair.com/us/products/fabric-air-ducts/fabrics/combi-70/#:~:text=Combi%2070%20,washable%20and%20retains%20its)\. So, any random mix of functional treatments in recycled fiber is undesirable for precision technical fabrics\.

## Compatibility Matrix Summary

- **Material \(100% PET\):** *FabricAir requires pure polyester\.* **Finnish workwear** is largely poly\-cotton blends \(e\.g\. 65&#x2F;35\)[d2ris6qfzcz0wn\.cloudfront\.net](https://d2ris6qfzcz0wn.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2025/03/Lindstrom-Sustainability-Brochure-2024-web.pdf#:~:text=The%20new%20fabric%20contains%2010,raw%20materials%20for%20the%20pro%02cess)\. Mechanical recycling cannot separate cotton from polyester, so blended input yields mixed fibers[lampoonmagazine\.com](https://lampoonmagazine.com/rester-recovery-fiber-plant-finland/#:~:text=The%20quality%20and%20the%20consistency,cotton%20out%20of%20polycotton%C2%BB)\. **Compatibility:** Only *sorted 100% polyester garments* \(or a process to remove cotton\) will meet this requirement\. Unsorted workwear waste would produce fiber that fails the 100% PET criterion\.
- **Fabric Weight \(~300 g&#x2F;m²\):** *FabricAir fabric is ~300 gsm, heavy and sturdy\.* **Finnish workwear fabrics** range ~200–300 gsm; standard workwear twills ~245 gsm[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/top-safety-features-of-workwear-in-automotive-industry/#:~:text=245), with some knitted or specialty fabrics at 290–300 gsm[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/sk/priemyselne-odvetvia/pracovne-odevy-pre-automobilovy-a-montazny-priemysel-a-strojarstvo/#:~:text=65%20PES%20%2F%2035%20CO%2C,50%20CO%2C%20300%20g)\. **Compatibility:** Many workwear textiles are in a similar weight class\. Recycled fiber from mid\-weight uniforms can be used to make a heavy fabric by adjusting weave or blending\. This is generally compatible – the recycled PET from workwear can be used to produce ~300 gsm fabric \(it may even require blending multiple lots to reach the needed weight and thickness, but technically achievable\)\.
- **Fiber Thickness&#x2F;Coarseness:** *FabricAir prefers a coarse fiber&#x2F;yarn \(for strength and because fine yarns aren’t needed\)\.* **Workwear polyester fibers** are originally medium\-to\-coarse denier, and after recycling they become shorter staples\. Spinning fine yarn from short staples is difficult – but spinning coarse yarn for heavy fabric is feasible[cikis\.studio](https://www.cikis.studio/en/article/interview-with-recover-the-mechanical-recycling-of-textile-fibers#:~:text=Recycled%20fibers%20with%20elastane%20content,products%2C%20elastane%20should%20be%20avoided)\. **Compatibility:** Good\. The mechanical recycling output will be a rough fiber suitable for thicker yarns, aligning with FabricAir’s coarse fabric needs\. \(In fact, trying to use recycled fiber for a fine high\-thread\-count fabric would be a problem, but for FabricAir it fits well\.\)
- **Color \(White Preference\):** *FabricAir ideally uses white or easily dyeable light fiber\.* **Finnish workwear** is mostly colored \(blues, blacks, hi\-vis colors\); white items \(lab coats, chef jackets, hospital textiles\) form a smaller subset\. **Compatibility:** Moderate\. It’s **necessary to sort out white or light\-colored polyester textiles** from the Finnish workwear stream if the goal is a white FabricAir duct[abtehnic\.eu](https://abtehnic.eu/dispersion-systems-textile-ducts/fabricair-poly/#:~:text=)\. Using mixed colors will result in a grayish recycled fiber that likely needs re\-dyeing in dark colors only\. For white end\-product, only white&#x2F;light feedstock should be used\. This requires coordination with textile collectors to source white workwear \(e\.g\. hospital uniforms or hotel textiles that are 100% PET\)\. If such sorting is done, color compatibility can be achieved\.
- **Chemical Treatments:** *FabricAir’s production process expects “clean” fiber that can be finished as needed \(e\.g\., applying flame retardant or antimicrobial coatings uniformly\)\.* **Finnish workwear waste** may carry legacy treatments: flame retardants, water&#x2F;soil repellents, anti\-static fibers, etc\. **Compatibility:** This is a **challenge area**\. FR\-treated clothing in the feed can introduce phosphorus or other chemicals that might affect flame performance or produce hazardous dust[blog\.tarasafe\.com](https://blog.tarasafe.com/2022/04/25/disposal-fr-clothing/#:~:text=Mechanical%20recycling%20of%20the%20textile,slightly%20inferior%20quality%20of%20product)\. Coated textiles \(PU&#x2F;PVC\) will contaminate or reduce the quality of recycled fiber if not removed[textileexchange\.org](https://textileexchange.org/other-synthetics/#:~:text=Virgin%20synthetics%20are%20made%20from,Though%20acrylic%20can%20be%20recycled)\. The presence of elastane or other polymers \(though less common in rigid workwear, except maybe stretch uniforms\) is also problematic, as elastane does not recycle well and should be excluded[textileexchange\.org](https://textileexchange.org/other-synthetics/#:~:text=Virgin%20synthetics%20can%20be%20hard,to%20recycle)\. **Mitigation:** Careful preprocessing is needed – remove or avoid garments with heavy coatings, and possibly limit FR\-treated garment recycling to separate batches\. If done right, one can obtain recycled PET fibers mostly free of undesirable additives\. For FabricAir, it would be safest to source feedstock from **plain, untreated polyester workwear** \(if available, e\.g\., standard polyester jackets without special finishes\)\.

In conclusion, **Finnish workwear\-derived polyester fibers can be made to meet FabricAir’s requirements, but only with proper sorting and handling**\. The main points of incompatibility – fiber purity and chemical treatments – must be addressed by selecting appropriate input textiles \(100% PET items, preferably white, with minimal coatings\)\. When those conditions are met, the recycled fiber \(though shorter\) is suitable for spinning into the coarse, heavy yarns needed for FabricAir’s ~300 g&#x2F;m² fabric ducts\. This creates a potential circular solution: retired Finnish work uniforms \(if predominantly polyester and light\-colored\) could be transformed into new FabricAir ventilation ducts, provided the recycling process is tuned to deliver **clean, white, 100% PET coarse fiber** that FabricAir can incorporate\. The table below summarizes the compatibility between FabricAir specs and Finnish workwear source material:

**FabricAir RequirementFinnish Workwear SourceCompatibility**

**100% PET \(Polyester\)**

*Partial*: Requires sorting to collect only 100% polyester garments\. Blends yield mixed fiber \(not acceptable\)[lampoonmagazine\.com](https://lampoonmagazine.com/rester-recovery-fiber-plant-finland/#:~:text=The%20quality%20and%20the%20consistency,cotton%20out%20of%20polycotton%C2%BB)\.

**~300 g&#x2F;m² Fabric Weight**

Workwear fabrics range ~200–300 gsm \(245 g&#x2F;m² common[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/top-safety-features-of-workwear-in-automotive-industry/#:~:text=245); heavy knit fabrics 290–300 g&#x2F;m² exist[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/sk/priemyselne-odvetvia/pracovne-odevy-pre-automobilovy-a-montazny-priemysel-a-strojarstvo/#:~:text=65%20PES%20%2F%2035%20CO%2C,50%20CO%2C%20300%20g)\)\.

*Good*: Many workwear textiles are medium\-to\-heavy\. Recycled fiber can be used in fabrics of ~300 gsm with proper yarn design\.

**Coarse Fiber &#x2F; Thick Yarn**

Workwear uses durable, thicker yarn; recycled fibers are shorter \(lower quality for fine yarn\)[cikis\.studio](https://www.cikis.studio/en/article/interview-with-recover-the-mechanical-recycling-of-textile-fibers#:~:text=Recycled%20fibers%20with%20elastane%20content,products%2C%20elastane%20should%20be%20avoided)\.

*Good*: Coarse yarns can be spun from recycled workwear fibers\. Fine\-count yarn would be problematic, but FabricAir doesn’t require fine yarn\.

**Preferably White Color**

Finnish uniforms mostly colored \(navy, hi\-vis, etc\.\); few white textiles \(e\.g\. lab coats\)\. Output fiber from mixed colors is gray\.

*Moderate*: To get white fiber, feed must be sorted to white&#x2F;light\-colored polyester\. Otherwise, colored feed yields non\-white fiber requiring re\-dyeing\.

**Minimal Finishes&#x2F;Coatings**

Some workwear has FR treatments, PU coatings, anti\-static fibers, etc\.[blog\.tarasafe\.com](https://blog.tarasafe.com/2022/04/25/disposal-fr-clothing/#:~:text=Mechanical%20recycling%20of%20the%20textile,slightly%20inferior%20quality%20of%20product)[textileexchange\.org](https://textileexchange.org/other-synthetics/#:~:text=Virgin%20synthetics%20are%20made%20from,Though%20acrylic%20can%20be%20recycled)\. These additives remain in shredded fiber\.

*Challenging*: Must exclude or minimize garments with heavy chemical finishes\. FR chemicals and PU coatings in input can hinder recycling and affect quality\. Best if input textiles are untreated polyester\.

**Flame Retardancy** \(in final product\)

FabricAir ducts often need to be flame\-retardant \(achieved via certified FR fabric or treatment\)[fabricair\.com](https://www.fabricair.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/fabric/combi-85-eng.pdf#:~:text=,washable%20and%20retains%20its)\. Some workwear is FR\-treated \(with chemical finishes or special fibers\)\.

*Manageable*: Recycled fiber from FR\-treated garments will contain some FR chemicals, but inconsistent\. Prefer to add uniform FR finish during new fabric production rather than rely on residuals\. Non\-FR recycled PET can be post\-treated to meet FR standards\.

**Sources:** The above analysis is based on Finnish workwear specifications \(e\.g\., Lindström workwear fabrics[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/top-safety-features-of-workwear-in-automotive-industry/#:~:text=65%20PES%2F%2035%20CO)[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/sk/priemyselne-odvetvia/pracovne-odevy-pre-automobilovy-a-montazny-priemysel-a-strojarstvo/#:~:text=65%20PES%20%2F%2035%20CO%2C,50%20CO%2C%20300%20g) and sustainability reports[d2ris6qfzcz0wn\.cloudfront\.net](https://d2ris6qfzcz0wn.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2025/03/Lindstrom-Sustainability-Brochure-2024-web.pdf#:~:text=The%20new%20fabric%20contains%2010,raw%20materials%20for%20the%20pro%02cess)\), data on mechanical recycling from Rester[lampoonmagazine\.com](https://lampoonmagazine.com/rester-recovery-fiber-plant-finland/#:~:text=The%20quality%20and%20the%20consistency,cotton%20out%20of%20polycotton%C2%BB), and FabricAir’s published material criteria[fabricairsa\.co\.za](https://www.fabricairsa.co.za/why-use-fabric.html#:~:text=The%20hygienic%20alternative%20to%20metal,it%20can%20simply%20be%20washed)[abtehnic\.eu](https://abtehnic.eu/dispersion-systems-textile-ducts/fabricair-poly/#:~:text=)\. Relevant considerations about recycling challenges \(fiber length, elastane, flame\-retardants, coatings\) are drawn from industry research and expert commentary[cikis\.studio](https://www.cikis.studio/en/article/interview-with-recover-the-mechanical-recycling-of-textile-fibers#:~:text=Recycled%20fibers%20with%20elastane%20content,products%2C%20elastane%20should%20be%20avoided)[blog\.tarasafe\.com](https://blog.tarasafe.com/2022/04/25/disposal-fr-clothing/#:~:text=Mechanical%20recycling%20of%20the%20textile,slightly%20inferior%20quality%20of%20product)[textileexchange\.org](https://textileexchange.org/other-synthetics/#:~:text=Virgin%20synthetics%20are%20made%20from,Though%20acrylic%20can%20be%20recycled)\. This compatibility matrix highlights that with **proper sorting and processing**, there is a viable overlap between Finnish workwear waste streams and FabricAir’s raw material needs – enabling a circular path from used uniforms to high\-performance air ducts\.
