# Lindström Group: Textile Service Volumes and Market Position

## Circular Textile Volumes and Sustainability Efforts

- **Waste Recycling Targets:** Lindström aims to recycle **100% of its end\-of\-life textile waste by 2025**[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-and-rester-launch-the-first-industrial-scale-textile-waste-refining-business-in-the-nordics/#:~:text=also%20cotton%20towel%20rolls%20for,waste%20textiles%20globally%20by%202025)\. In its home market of Finland, Lindström partnered with Rester Oy to launch the Nordics’ first industrial\-scale textile waste refinery in 2021 – capable of processing about **500 tons of textile waste per year** \(roughly 400 tons of worn\-out workwear annually in Finland\)[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-and-rester-launch-the-first-industrial-scale-textile-waste-refining-business-in-the-nordics/#:~:text=also%20cotton%20towel%20rolls%20for,waste%20textiles%20globally%20by%202025)[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-and-rester-launch-the-first-industrial-scale-textile-waste-refining-business-in-the-nordics/#:~:text=is%20a%20kick,many%20different%20fibers%20and%20materials)\. This partnership is key to Lindström’s strategy, as it allows nearly all discarded workwear to be recycled instead of incinerated\.
- **Recycling Progress:** Lindström has made rapid progress toward its 100% recycling goal\. As of the early 2020s, the company’s global textile waste recycling rate surged from virtually 0% in 2019 to **74%** by 2022[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/circularity-in-textiles-our-circular-economy-business-model/#:~:text=1.%20End)\. The latest sustainability report indicates about **70%** of all Lindström’s textile waste is now being recycled \(a slight dip, –4 percentage points, from the previous year\)[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/sustainability/reducing-textile-waste-and-conserving-resources/#:~:text=Textile%20recycling)\. These figures are **confirmed** in Lindström’s reports and show that the majority of textiles removed from service are finding a new life\. For example, **Lindström India already recycles 100%** of its textile waste, demonstrating that circular practices are achievable in its operations[textileworld\.com](https://www.textileworld.com/textile-world/knitting-apparel/2024/08/eco-innovation-in-textiles-lindstrom-sustainability-report-sets-new-industry-benchmarks/#:~:text=4.%20End,the%20country%E2%80%99s%20commitment%20to%20sustainability)\. The remaining unrecycled portion \(e\.g\. heavily soiled or non\-recyclable textiles\) is generally sent to energy recovery rather than landfill\.
- **Regional Initiatives:** Lindström has developed recycling collaborations in each market to boost volumes\. In Finland and the Baltics, Rester’s facility handles Lindström’s workwear and other textiles; in **China**, Lindström works with DingYuan Textile Technology in Hangzhou\. The most recent report \(autumn 2023\) shows **over 11,000 kg** of Lindström’s textile waste from its China operations was sent to DingYuan’s plant in one year[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/collaborating-for-sustainable-textile-solutions-with-dingyuan-textile-technology/#:~:text=The%20latest%20report%20from%20autumn,of%20their%20energy%20from%20coal)\. **Nearly 90%** of that waste was successfully recycled – primarily turned into new products like storage boxes – with only unrecyclable remnants \(e\.g\. shoes, oil\-soiled rags\) used as biomass fuel[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/collaborating-for-sustainable-textile-solutions-with-dingyuan-textile-technology/#:~:text=The%20latest%20report%20from%20autumn,of%20their%20energy%20from%20coal)\. This confirmed volume \(11 metric tons\) is relatively small but reflects Lindström’s expanding circular ecosystem in Asia\. Similar partnerships are being pursued in other countries to reach the **“zero textile waste”** vision globally[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-and-rester-launch-the-first-industrial-scale-textile-waste-refining-business-in-the-nordics/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20workwear%2C%20the,plants%2C%20to%20Rester%20for%20processing)\.
- **Repair &amp; Reuse Volumes:** A cornerstone of Lindström’s circular economy model is extending the life of textiles through reuse and repair\. **In 2023, Lindström repaired garments and textiles over 4\.8 million times** – real maintenance interventions that significantly prolonged product lifespans[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstromers-in-figures/#:~:text=With%20a%20clear%20majority%2C%20most,as%20the%20person%20you%20are)\. \(There are over 160 professional sewers on staff, the vast majority women, dedicated to mending textiles[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstromers-in-figures/#:~:text=With%20a%20clear%20majority%2C%20most,as%20the%20person%20you%20are)\.\) At the group level, Lindström reports it **repaired ~4\.5 million workwear garments and 4\.8 million other textile items in a single year**, thereby **avoiding “millions of kilograms” of unnecessary new textile production**[textileworld\.com](https://www.textileworld.com/textile-world/knitting-apparel/2024/08/eco-innovation-in-textiles-lindstrom-sustainability-report-sets-new-industry-benchmarks/#:~:text=Key%20Highlights%20of%20the%20Report%3A)\. These figures are **confirmed** outcomes \(not projections\) and underline how large Lindström’s service volume is – by repairing and reusing uniforms, mats, and linens on this scale, the company minimizes the need for new fabric manufacture\. In practical terms, Lindström’s long\-running “textiles\-as\-a\-service” model \(rental with regular washing, delivery, and repair\) means each item is used to its maximum usable life before being recycled[textileworld\.com](https://www.textileworld.com/textile-world/knitting-apparel/2024/08/eco-innovation-in-textiles-lindstrom-sustainability-report-sets-new-industry-benchmarks/#:~:text=4.%20End,30%20percent%20smaller)[textileworld\.com](https://www.textileworld.com/textile-world/knitting-apparel/2024/08/eco-innovation-in-textiles-lindstrom-sustainability-report-sets-new-industry-benchmarks/#:~:text=4.%20End,the%20country%E2%80%99s%20commitment%20to%20sustainability)\.

## Business Scale and Market Position

- **Scale of Operations:** Lindström Group is one of Europe’s largest textile service companies, with a **175\-year history** in the industry[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-and-rester-launch-the-first-industrial-scale-textile-waste-refining-business-in-the-nordics/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Lindstr%C3%B6m%20GroupImage%3A%20Lindstr%C3%B6m%20Group)\. It operates in **23–24 countries** across Europe and Asia, serving about **182,000 customer sites** \(businesses in sectors ranging from food processing and healthcare to hospitality and manufacturing\)[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstromers-in-figures/#:~:text=All%20Lindstr%C3%B6mers%20work%20to%20ensure,the%20good%20of%20our%20customers)\. This extensive customer base is supported by approximately **4,700 employees** worldwide[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-continues-to-support-resters-growth/#:~:text=on%20the%20circular%20economy,com%2Ffi)\. Lindström’s textile rental pool is enormous – by 2022 the company had “**tens of millions of garments**” in active circulation among its customers[texfash\.com](https://texfash.com/special/lindstrom-at-work-how-finnish-innovation-is-rewriting-future-of-workwear-and-recycling#:~:text=The%20Flex%20service%20takes%20this,the%20replacements%20came%20with%20RFID)\. \(Every garment is RFID\-tagged to track usage, and Lindström notes that digitizing its inventory management has enabled clients to use up to **40% fewer textiles** while still meeting their needs – a direct sustainability benefit from scale and data management[texfash\.com](https://texfash.com/special/lindstrom-at-work-how-finnish-innovation-is-rewriting-future-of-workwear-and-recycling#:~:text=right%20time)\.\) In financial terms, Lindström’s **annual turnover was €506 million in 2023**[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-continues-to-support-resters-growth/#:~:text=on%20the%20circular%20economy,com%2Ffi), up from €408 million in 2019[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-accelerates-future-growth-in-asia-by-acquiring-the-worlds-biggest-textile-services-company/#:~:text=The%20Lindstr%C3%B6m%20Group%20Lindstr%C3%B6m%20is,com)\. This revenue size \(half a billion euros\) firmly places Lindström among the top textile service firms in Europe, albeit behind the very largest player, Elis of France \(Elis’s revenues exceed €3–4 billion\)[interconnectionconsulting\.com](https://www.interconnectionconsulting.com/en/industries-markets/miettextilien/#:~:text=Market%20Leader%20Elis%20Expands%20Position,%E2%80%93%20Consolidation%20Gains%20Momentum)[interconnectionconsulting\.com](https://www.interconnectionconsulting.com/en/industries-markets/miettextilien/#:~:text=The%20top%2010%20companies%20in,the%20acquisition%20of%20competitor%20KALHYGE)\.
- **Home Market Leadership:** In Finland, Lindström’s home country, the company holds a dominant market position\. It is a **clear market leader** in textile rental&#x2F;services domestically – evidenced by the fact that a large share of the company’s revenue still comes from Finland\. For instance, in 2015 Lindström had global sales of about $339 million, and **roughly half of that was generated in Finland alone**[koreatimes\.co\.kr](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/tech-science/20160922/lindstrom-bets-big-on-korea#:~:text=Lindstrom%20has%20a%20history%20of,only%20about%20five%20million%20population)\. Given Finland’s small population \(~5 million\), this indicates an exceptionally high penetration of Lindström’s services in the Finnish market\. \(By comparison, Lindström’s next\-largest country operations are much smaller in revenue\.\) The company’s strong Finnish base provided a springboard for international expansion, and it remains headquartered in Helsinki\. Lindström’s **brand is virtually synonymous with textile services in Finland**, and its scale there gives it economies of scale and expertise that few competitors can match in that region\.
- **European Market Position:** Regionally, Lindström is recognized as **one of the leading textile service providers in Europe**\. It offers a broad range of services – workwear rental, cleanroom apparel, floor mats, hotel linens, washroom towels, industrial wipers, and more – allowing it to compete across many sectors\. In Western Europe’s mature markets, giants like Elis \(France\), CWS \(Germany\), Johnson Service Group \(UK\), and others are key players, but Lindström \(with ~€500M revenue\) is generally counted among the top 5–10 companies in the European textile rental industry[interconnectionconsulting\.com](https://www.interconnectionconsulting.com/en/industries-markets/miettextilien/#:~:text=Market%20Leader%20Elis%20Expands%20Position,%E2%80%93%20Consolidation%20Gains%20Momentum)[interconnectionconsulting\.com](https://www.interconnectionconsulting.com/en/industries-markets/miettextilien/#:~:text=leader%20in%20Western%20Europe%20and,market%20share%20of%20around%2048)\. In **Central and Eastern Europe \(CEE\)**, Lindström is even more prominent: industry analysis shows that the main competitors in CEE are **Elis, CWS, Lindström, and Salesianer Miettex**, which **together command ~54% of the CEE textile services market**[interconnectionconsulting\.com](https://www.interconnectionconsulting.com/en/industries-markets/miettextilien/#:~:text=The%20main%20competitors%20are%20Elis,enormous%20potential%20for%20companies%20that)\. In other words, Lindström is part of the elite group of firms that collectively control over half the market in that region\. This third\-party data **confirms** Lindström’s significant market share outside its home country\. The company’s strategy of localized service centers in many countries \(often greenfield investments or acquisitions\) has secured it strong positions in markets like Hungary, the Baltics, and Russia \(until suspension\), where it often became one of the top 2–3 players\. Notably, **no other Finnish company** in this sector has Lindström’s international footprint – it has achieved a rare position as a Finnish B2B service multinational\.
- **Asia Expansion and Leadership:** Over the past decade, Lindström has aggressively expanded in Asia, staking out leadership in emerging textile service markets\. It entered **China** in 2006 and **India** in 2007, well ahead of most global competitors, effectively creating the organized workwear rental market in those countries\. According to Lindström’s CEO, by the mid\-2010s Lindström **held the No\.1 market share in B2B textile rental services in both China and India**[koreatimes\.co\.kr](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/tech-science/20160922/lindstrom-bets-big-on-korea#:~:text=The%20company%20operates%20businesses%20in,B2B%20textile%20rental%20service%20market) – largely because few local firms offered similar rental models at scale\. These claims were echoed in interviews and reflect Lindström’s first\-mover advantage\. To solidify its lead, Lindström also made strategic acquisitions: in 2020 it acquired Cintas Corporation’s operations in China, instantly doubling its size there\. After this deal, Lindström stated the new entity would be **“a clear market leader in workwear rental and cleanroom business in China’s fast\-growing market\.”**[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-accelerates-future-growth-in-asia-by-acquiring-the-worlds-biggest-textile-services-company/#:~:text=Finnish%20multinational%20textile%20services%20group,portfolio%20to%20new%20service%20lines) Indeed, absorbing Cintas’s Chinese service centers gave Lindström a dominant presence in several major industrial regions\. Today, Lindström is one of the largest international textile service companies operating in Asia \(though in absolute size its Asian revenues are still smaller than its European business\)\. The **confirmed outcome** of the Cintas China acquisition was that Lindström’s China workforce grew to ~550 people and it now serves over 1,000 customers there, far outpacing any local rivals[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-accelerates-future-growth-in-asia-by-acquiring-the-worlds-biggest-textile-services-company/#:~:text=Cintas%20is%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20biggest,be%20integrated%20into%20Lindstr%C3%B6m%E2%80%99s%20business)\. In **India**, Lindström similarly leads the organized workwear rental segment; it has built multiple laundries across the country and even introduced innovative concepts like garment dispensing machines\. Lindström’s Asian growth is part of its Vision 2025 to be the leader in sustainable rental textiles in Asia[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-accelerates-future-growth-in-asia-by-acquiring-the-worlds-biggest-textile-services-company/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20focus%20on%20the%20Asian,CEO%20of%20the%20Lindstr%C3%B6m%20Group)\. While these markets are still developing \(and competitors are emerging\), Lindström’s position is **substantially ahead of any traditional local laundry services**, giving it a strong platform as demand for outsourced workwear rises\.
- **Summary – Confirmed vs\. Estimated Figures:** All the volume figures provided above are backed by official or reputable sources\. For example, the **500 tons&#x2F;year textile recycling figure** is an *estimated* capacity from Lindström’s Rester partnership announcement \(a forward\-looking commitment\)[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-and-rester-launch-the-first-industrial-scale-textile-waste-refining-business-in-the-nordics/#:~:text=also%20cotton%20towel%20rolls%20for,waste%20textiles%20globally%20by%202025), whereas the **74% recycling rate and 4\.8 million repairs** are *confirmed actuals* reported in Lindström’s 2022–2023 sustainability reports[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/circularity-in-textiles-our-circular-economy-business-model/#:~:text=1.%20End)[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstromers-in-figures/#:~:text=With%20a%20clear%20majority%2C%20most,as%20the%20person%20you%20are)\. We have distinguished these where relevant\. In sum, Lindström Group handles **hundreds of thousands of textile items daily** across its network, which translates to recycling on the order of **hundreds of tons per year** and service volumes in the **millions of pieces** – numbers that underscore its status as a major global player in textile services\. Its market position is characterized by **dominance in Finland, top\-tier standing in Europe, and leading roles in select Asian markets**, all achieved through a combination of scale, sustainability focus, and 175\+ years of expertise[lindstromgroup\.com](https://lindstromgroup.com/lindstrom-and-rester-launch-the-first-industrial-scale-textile-waste-refining-business-in-the-nordics/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Lindstr%C3%B6m%20GroupImage%3A%20Lindstr%C3%B6m%20Group)\. The company continues to expand its volumes \(organically and via acquisitions\) and is on track to meet or exceed many of its sustainability targets, barring unforeseen challenges, thus reinforcing both its competitive and responsible leadership in the industry\.
