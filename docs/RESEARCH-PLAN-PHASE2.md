# Research Plan: Phase 2 — Closing the Gaps

**Created:** 2025-11-29
**Purpose:** Address gaps identified in Critical Assessment
**Target Completion:** 2-3 weeks from initiation
**Resources Required:** Research analyst + AI tools + direct outreach

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 research achieved 78% delivery against FabricAir's requirements. Phase 2 focuses on closing four critical gaps:

1. **Operational contacts** — Find the people who actually manage textile waste disposal
2. **Material verification** — Confirm which products are truly 100% polyester
3. **Volume quantification** — Determine accessible 100% white polyester volumes
4. **Capacity confirmation** — Verify Rester's available (uncommitted) capacity

**Expected outcome:** Raise delivery score from 78% to 90%+, providing FabricAir with actionable intelligence for commercial engagement.

### Workstream 3: Volume Quantification

**Objective:** Estimate the actual volume of 100% white polyester available in Finland.

**Current Knowledge:**
- Total textile waste: 85,770 tonnes/year
- Workwear segment: Unknown portion of total
- 100% polyester portion: Unknown
- White color portion: Unknown

**Research Approach:**

**Step 1: Top-Down Estimation**
```
Total textile waste: 85,770 t/yr
├── Consumer textiles: ~70% = 60,000 t
└── Professional textiles: ~30% = 25,700 t
    ├── Workwear: ~60% = 15,400 t
    │   ├── 65/35 blends: ~70% = 10,800 t
    │   └── 100% polyester: ~30% = 4,600 t
    │       └── White: ~40% = 1,840 t ← TARGET
    └── Other (linens, etc.): ~40% = 10,300 t
```

**Step 2: Bottom-Up Validation**

| Source | Est. Volume | Calculation Basis |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Lindström EOL | 400 t/yr | Company statement |
| Puro healthcare | 200-500 t/yr | 45M items × retirement rate |
| Hospital direct | 100-200 t/yr | University hospitals |
| Cleanroom sector | 50-100 t/yr | ~3,000 employees × replacement |
| Food industry | 100-200 t/yr | Major processors |
| **Estimated total** | **850-1,400 t/yr** | Bottom-up |

**Step 3: Expert Validation**

Contact Rester directly:
```
Questions for Rester:
1. What volume of 100% polyester do you currently receive annually?
2. Of that, what percentage is white/light colored?
3. What are your main feedstock sources?
4. What quality grades do you produce from white polyester input?
```

Contact LSJH:
```
Questions for LSJH:
1. In your sorting operations, what % of professional textiles is 100% polyester?
2. What composition breakdown do you see in sorted textile streams?
3. Do you have NIR sorting data by fiber type?
```

**Deliverable:** Volume estimate report with confidence intervals:

| Stream | Low Estimate | Mid Estimate | High Estimate | Confidence |
|--------|--------------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| 100% white PET available | 850 t/yr | 1,100 t/yr | 1,400 t/yr | Medium |

**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours
