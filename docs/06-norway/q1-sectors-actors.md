# Q1: Sectors & Actors — Norway

> What sectors and actors in Norway use high-quality polyester fibers (durable uniforms, workwear, preferably white)?

---

## Key Finding

**Healthcare is Norway's largest sector for workwear textiles with ~155,000 employees.** Most use 50/50 poly-cotton blends, but NTG's defibration technology can process these. For pure 100% polyester/polyamide, target cleanroom (Takeda, GE Healthcare).

## Strategic Implications

1. **Healthcare volume is significant** — but requires NTG for blend processing
2. **Food processing is secondary** — lower volume, mixed compositions
3. **Cleanroom is best quality** — but smallest volume
4. **NTG is the enabler** — unlocks healthcare stream that others can't process
