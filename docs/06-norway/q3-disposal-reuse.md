# Q3: Disposal & Reuse — Norway

> How are polyester textiles disposed of in Norway, and what are reuse levels?

---

## Key Finding

**Norway exports 97% of textile waste — the highest in the Nordic region.** With ~100,000 tonnes/year generated, this represents massive untapped potential for domestic recycling via NTG.

---

## Waste Generation

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total textile waste | ~100,000 t/yr | SSB |
| Per capita | 19.3 kg/yr | Highest in Nordic |
| Post-consumer | ~90% | Estimate |
| Pre-consumer | ~10% | Manufacturing waste |

### Nordic Comparison

| Country | Per Capita | Total |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Norway** | **19.3 kg** | **~100k t** |
| Finland | ~15 kg | ~86k t |
| Sweden | 8-11 kg | 60-80k t |

---

## Current Disposal Routes

| Route | Percentage | Volume | Destination |
|-------|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Export** | **97%** | ~97,000 t | Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia |
| Reuse (domestic) | ~2% | ~2,000 t | Second-hand market |
| Material Recycling | <1% | <1,000 t | NTG R&D only |
| Landfill | ~0% | — | Banned for organic waste |

## Export Dependency

### Why 97% Export?

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| No domestic recyclers | Critical |
| Limited sorting capacity | High |
| Economic incentive | Export cheaper than domestic processing |
| Infrastructure gap | No investment until NTG |

### Export Destinations

| Region | Percentage | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Eastern Europe | ~50% | Reuse, downcycling |
| Africa | ~30% | Reuse market |
| Asia | ~15% | Recycling, downcycling |
| Other | ~5% | Various |

## Professional Textile Waste

### Healthcare Sector

| Region | Employees | Textile Volume |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Helse Sør-Øst | 85,000 | 4-6k t/yr |
| Helse Vest | 28,000 | 1.5-2k t/yr |
| Helse Midt-Norge | 22,000 | 1-1.5k t/yr |
| Helse Nord | 20,000 | 1-1.5k t/yr |
| **Total** | **155,000** | **8-11k t/yr** |

### Textile Service Companies

| Company | End-of-Life Volume | Current Disposition |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Nor Tekstil | ~3,000 t/yr | Export/Incineration |
| Elis Norge | ~1,500 t/yr | Export/Incineration |
| Others | ~1,000 t/yr | Mixed |

---

## NTG's Impact

### Current (2024)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Capacity | 2,000 t/yr |
| Type | R&D facility |
| Location | Sandefjord |

### Future (~2029)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Capacity | 30,000 t/yr |
| Type | Full commercial |
| Impact | Absorbs 30% of Norway's textile waste |

### NTS Sorting (NTG subsidiary)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Technology | AI + hyperspectral camera |
| Accuracy | >95% fiber identification |
| Status | Scaling |

---

## Barriers to Domestic Recycling

| Barrier | Impact | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| No recycling infrastructure | Critical | Changing (NTG) |
| Export economics | High | Will shift with EPR |
| Sorting capacity | Medium | NTS scaling |
| Collection fragmentation | Medium | Improving |

---

## Future Changes

### Mandatory Collection (January 2025)

- Municipalities must provide textile collection
- Expected volume increase
- Sorting infrastructure needed

### EPR Implementation (Date TBD)

- Producer responsibility
- Collection/recycling targets
- Fee structure based on recyclability

### NTG Full Scale (~2029)

- 30,000 t/yr capacity
- Domestic recycling option
- Reduced export dependency

---

## Implications for FabricAir

1. **Current:** 97% export means waste streams established but not recycled
2. **Opportunity:** Redirect professional textile flows to NTG
3. **Healthcare:** Largest volume via Nor Tekstil and Elis
4. **Timing:** NTG scaling creates partnership opportunity now
