# Q2: Value Chain Stakeholders — Norway

> Who are the main stakeholders in production, use, and reuse of polyester textiles in Norway?

---

## Key Finding

**Norway exports 97% of textile waste due to lack of domestic infrastructure.** NTG is building the region's largest recycling capacity (30k t/yr by ~2029) which will fundamentally transform the value chain.

## Value Chain Overview

```
Production → Use → Collection → Sorting → Export (97%)
                       ↓
                   [Fretex]      ↓
                   13,500 t   [NTG R&D]
                                2,000 t
                                   ↓
                           [NTG Full Scale]
                              30,000 t (~2029)

## NTG Deep Dive

### Company Profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Full name | Norsk Tekstilgjenvinning AS |
| Location | Sandefjord |
| Founded | 2020 |
| CEO | Bent Tatsuyama Mathisen |
| CGO/Founder | Pål Erik Haraldsen |
| Technology | Patented mechanical defibration |

### Technology

**Defibration vs Shredding:**
- Traditional: Shreds fibers → short, weak
- NTG: Cuts fibers → preserves length for respinning

**Unique capability:** Processes poly-cotton blends that other recyclers cannot

### Capacity Trajectory

| Year | Capacity | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| 2024 | 2,000 t/yr | R&D facility |
| 2027 | 10,000 t/yr | Scaling |
| ~2029 | 30,000 t/yr | Full commercial |

### Funding

| Source | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Innovation Norway | NOK 30M+ |
| Private investors | Undisclosed |

### Certifications

- GRS certification in progress
- ISO compliance

## Plast Nordic / Norner

### Partnership

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Lead | Plast Nordic |
| Technology partner | Norner (Porsgrunn) |
| Technology | gr3n microwave depolymerization |
| Target | Full-scale by 2028 |
| Impurity tolerance | Up to 30% |

### Strategic Significance

## Strategic Implications

1. **NTG is the linchpin** — only recycler, fastest-growing Nordic capacity
2. **97% export creates opportunity** — redirecting flows to NTG
3. **Healthcare via procurement** — Sykehusinnkjøp controls access
4. **Dual technology future** — NTG (mechanical) + Plast Nordic (chemical)
