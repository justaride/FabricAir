## Major Initiatives

### NTG (Norsk Tekstilgjenvinning) — CRITICAL

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Type | Mechanical recycling |
| Technology | Patented defibration |
| R&D facility | **2,000 t/yr (opened Jan 2024)** |
| Target capacity | 30,000 t/yr (**~2027** — accelerated) |
| Location | Sandefjord (Pindslekvartalet) |
| Funding | NOK 30M+ from Innovation Norway (verified Dec 2025) |
| Ramp-up | ~2k (2025) → ~5k (2026) → ~30k (2027) |

**Key Innovation:**
- Defibration **cuts** fibers (vs. shredding)
- Preserves fiber length for respinning
- **Uniquely handles poly-cotton blends**

**Leadership:**
| Role | Name | Contact |
|------|------|---------|
| CEO | Bent Tatsuyama Mathisen | btm@ntgas.no |
| CGO/Founder | Pål Erik Haraldsen | — |

**NTS Sorting Facility (opened Aug 2024):**

- AI + hyperspectral camera sorting
- >95% purity identification by fiber + color
- Automated trim removal
- GRS certification in progress
- **Intent to sell sorting technology**
- Fully operational by end 2024

**Strategic Significance:**
- NTG R&D facility Jan 2024 + NTS sorting Aug 2024 = **complete value chain**
- Only Nordic facility processing poly-cotton blends to textile-grade fiber
- **Full-scale 30,000 t/yr by ~2027** (timeline accelerated from ~2029)
- Output customers: Norwegian wool industry + European spinning mills
