## Q1: Sectors & Actors

> **What sectors and actors in Norway use high-quality polyester fibers?**

### Answer

The Norwegian textile services market is **€180-270 million/year** (2-3 billion NOK). Healthcare is the largest sector with ~155,000 employees using uniforms. However, most workwear uses poly-cotton blends.

### Best Sources for 100% White Polyester/Polyamide

| Priority | Sector | White % | 100% PET/PA | Key Players |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Healthcare | 65% | Often blends | Helse Sør-Øst, OUS, Helse Bergen |
| 2 | Food Processing | 55% | Mixed | Nortura, TINE, Orkla |
| 3 | Pharma/Cleanroom | 90% | Yes | Takeda, GE Healthcare |

### Key Finding

**Healthcare is the largest volume source but uses 50/50 poly-cotton.** NTG's unique defibration technology can process these blends, making Norway's workwear accessible.

## Q2: Value Chain Stakeholders

> **Who are the main stakeholders in production, use, and reuse of polyester textiles in Norway?**

### Answer

Norway's textile ecosystem exports 97% of textile waste due to lack of domestic infrastructure. NTG is changing this with the Nordic region's fastest-growing recycling capacity.

### Key Stakeholders by Role

| Role | Key Players | Market Position |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Recycling** | NTG | Fastest-growing Nordic recycler |
| **Textile Services** | Nor Tekstil, Elis | Dominate healthcare textiles |
| **Collection** | Fretex, UFF | Major collection networks |
| **Research** | SIFO, Norner | Technology development |

### Critical Partnership

```
NTG: 2,000 t/yr (now) → 30,000 t/yr (~2027)
Technology: Patented defibration (cuts, not shreds)
Unique: Handles poly-cotton blends
```

## Q3: Disposal & Reuse

> **How are polyester textiles disposed of in Norway, and what are reuse levels?**

### Answer

Norway generates **~100,000 tonnes/year** of textile waste (highest per capita in Nordic at 19.3 kg) with **97% exported** due to lack of domestic infrastructure.

### Current Disposal Routes

| Route | Percentage | Volume |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Export | 97% | ~97,000 t |
| Reuse (domestic) | ~2% | ~2,000 t |
| **Material Recycling** | **<1%** | <1,000 t |

### Key Finding

**Norway has the worst domestic processing in Nordic** — nearly all waste exported. NTG's scaling will fundamentally change this by ~2027.

## Q4: Regulations

> **What regulations govern polyester textile disposal/reuse, and how will they evolve?**

### Answer

Norway has mandatory textile collection from January 2025, but EPR implementation date is **under review** (originally expected 2027, may be delayed to 2028).

### Regulatory Timeline

| Date | Regulation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| 2009 | Landfill organic waste ban | In force |
| Jan 2025 | Mandatory collection | In force |
| 2026-27 | Digital Product Passport | Upcoming |
| **TBD** | **EPR implementation** | **Under review** |

### Key Finding

**EPR uncertainty is Norway's biggest regulatory risk.** Unlike Finland (2027-28) and Sweden (Apr 2028), Norway has not confirmed its timeline.

## Q5: Initiatives

> **What public and private initiatives exist in Norway for polyester collection and reuse?**

### Answer

NTG dominates Norway's recycling initiative landscape with NOK 30M+ in Innovation Norway funding. Plast Nordic is developing chemical PET recycling for 2028.

### Active Initiatives

| Initiative | Type | Status | Role |
|------------|------|--------|------|
| **NTG** | Private | Scaling | Primary recycler |
| **Plast Nordic** | Private | Development | Chemical PET (2028) |
| **Fretex** | Social | Operational | Collection (13,500 t/yr) |
| **Norwegian RE:Textile** | Pilot | Development | Regional sorting |

### Critical Discovery: NTG

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Technology | Patented mechanical defibration |
| Current | 2,000 t/yr (R&D facility) |
| Target | 30,000 t/yr (~2027) |
| Unique | **Handles poly-cotton blends** |
| Funding | NOK 30M+ from Innovation Norway |

## Summary: Key Answers

| Question | Key Answer |
|----------|------------|
| Q1 | Healthcare largest volume; NTG can process blends |
| Q2 | 97% export; NTG is game-changer |
| Q3 | ~100k t/year waste; minimal domestic processing |
| Q4 | EPR uncertain; collection mandatory Jan 2025 |
| Q5 | NTG + Plast Nordic building dual infrastructure |
| Q6 | NTG + Nor Tekstil are immediate priorities |

### Critical Discovery

**NTG's patented defibration technology** — cuts fibers rather than shredding, preserving length for respinning. Uniquely handles poly-cotton blends, opening access to workwear streams other recyclers cannot process.

### Norway Advantage

| Factor | Advantage |
|--------|-----------|
| NTG capacity | Largest planned (30k t/yr by ~2027) |
| Technology | Handles blends others can't |
| Competition | Lower feedstock competition |
| Scale | Fastest-growing Nordic recycler |
