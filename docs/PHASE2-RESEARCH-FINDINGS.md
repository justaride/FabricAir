# Phase 2 Research Findings

**Research Date:** 2025-11-29
**Purpose:** Close gaps identified in Critical Assessment

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 research addressed the critical gaps identified in our delivery assessment. Key findings include **verification of 3 previously unverified contacts**, discovery of a **critical material compatibility issue with Lindström**, and confirmation that **Rester's capacity may be partially locked** by existing partnerships.

### Critical Discovery

**Lindström uses 65:35 poly-cotton blends — NOT 100% polyester.** This means their 400 t/year end-of-life volume is NOT suitable for FabricAir's requirements. This finding significantly impacts our Top 10 ranking.

## 1. Contact Verification Results

### Verified Contacts

| Organization | Contact | Role | Email | Status |
|--------------|---------|------|-------|--------|
| Orion | Carolina Sved | Head of Indirect & Sustainable Procurement | carolina.sved@orion.fi | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Valio | Hanna Hiekkamies | SVP Group Sustainability | hanna.hiekkamies@valio.fi | ✅ VERIFIED |
| KONE | Hanna Uusitalo | VP Environment & Sustainability | hanna.uusitalo@kone.com | ✅ VERIFIED |

### Contact Level Assessment

**Important Finding:** All three verified contacts are at **strategic/executive level**, not operational level. These are sustainability directors, NOT the people who manage day-to-day textile waste disposal.

| Contact | Level | Appropriate For |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Carolina Sved | Strategic | Partnership discussions, policy |
| Hanna Hiekkamies | Strategic | ESG initiatives, strategic sourcing |
| Hanna Uusitalo | Strategic | Environmental strategy |

**Gap Remains:** We still need operational contacts (facilities managers, waste coordinators) for actual textile disposal decisions.

## 3. Rester Capacity & Partnership Analysis

### Current Status

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current capacity | 6,000 tonnes/year |
| Future capacity | 12,000 tonnes/year |
| % of Finland textile waste | ~10% at full capacity |
| Operational since | November 2021 |
| Location | Paimio, Finland |
| Sweden office | Opened 2022 |

### Confirmed Partners

| Partner | Relationship | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Marimekko | Customer | Brand partner |
| Lindström | Investor + Customer | 2nd largest shareholder |
| Södra | Technology partner | "Innovator of the Year" award |
| LSJH (Lounais-Suomen Jätehuolto) | Feedstock | Consumer waste management |
| Touchpoint | Majority owner | Founded Rester |

### Investors

| Investor | Type |
|----------|------|
| Touchpoint | Founder, majority owner |
| Taaleri | Financial investor |
| Lindström Group | Strategic investor |
| Tesi | Financial investor |
| Besodos Investors | Financial investor |

### Capacity Lock Risk: CONFIRMED

Lindström's dual role as **investor AND customer** creates a significant capacity lock risk. Their 400 t/year volume (even if blended) likely has priority access to Rester's processing capacity.

### EU Horizon Project

Rester is participating in **PESCO-UP** EU Horizon project with 19 other organizations, focusing on transforming mixed polyester/cotton waste into high-quality materials. This may expand their capabilities for handling blends.

## 4. Material Composition Findings

### Critical Finding: Lindström Material

**Lindström workwear uses 65:35 poly-cotton blends — NOT 100% polyester.**

This finding was confirmed through web research. The implication is significant:

| Previous Assumption | Reality |
|---------------------|---------|
| Lindström provides 400 t/year of recyclable material | Material is 65:35 blend, NOT suitable for FabricAir |
| Lindström is a priority volume source | Must be reclassified as incompatible feedstock |

### Cleanroom Garment Specifications

| Provider | Material | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Standard cleanroom | 99% polyester + 1-6% polyester/carbon | Carbon for ESD protection |
| Lindström cleanroom | Meets EN-14065, ISO 14644 | Pharmaceutical grade |
| Elis cleanroom | Sterile garments | Operates in Finland |

**Implication:** Cleanroom garments typically contain 1-6% carbon fiber for anti-static properties. Need to verify if this is compatible with FabricAir's requirements.

### Touchpoint ReTouch Fabric

Touchpoint's circular fabric **ReTouch** contains recycled cotton/polyester — it is a blend, not 100% polyester. However, Touchpoint manages workwear from multiple sectors, some of which may be 100% PET.

---

## 5. Competitive Intelligence

### Pure Waste Finland

| Factor | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Source material | Cutting waste from India |
| Why not Finland? | "If we wanted to manufacture fabrics in Finland, we would have to use used clothes as raw material. However, that is not yet possible in terms of quality" — Anders Bengs, Founder |
| Competing for Finnish feedstock? | **NO** — They source from India |

**Strategic Implication:** Pure Waste is NOT competing for Finnish post-consumer polyester. They use pre-consumer cutting waste from Indian factories.

### Other Potential Competitors

| Company | Focus | Threat Level |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Reima | Consumer recycled polyester | Low (different market) |
| Marimekko | Design focus, Rester customer | Low (not feedstock competitor) |

---

## 6. Volume Quantification Progress

### What We Know

| Category | Volume | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Total Finnish textile waste | 85,770 t/year | SYKE 2021 |
| Rester capacity | 6,000-12,000 t/year | Rester website |
| Lindström end-of-life | 400 t/year | Company data |
| Puro throughput | 45M items/year | Company data |

### What We Still Don't Know

1. **How much of total textile waste is workwear vs consumer?**
2. **How much workwear is 100% polyester vs blends?**
3. **How much 100% polyester is white?**
4. **What volume does Rester have available (not committed)?**

### Best Estimate for 100% White Polyester

| Sector | Estimated Volume | Confidence |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| Cleanroom/Pharma | 50-200 t/year | Medium |
| Healthcare (white) | 200-500 t/year | Low |
| Food processing (white) | 100-300 t/year | Low |
| **Total accessible** | **350-1,000 t/year** | Low |

**Note:** This is significantly lower than our previous "5,000-10,000 tonnes" estimate because we now know Lindström volume is blended.

## 9. Remaining Gaps

### Still Unresolved

| Gap | Priority | Effort to Close |
|-----|----------|-----------------|
| Operational waste contacts at Orion, Valio, KONE | High | Requires direct outreach |
| Rester available capacity (not committed) | High | Requires direct conversation |
| 100% polyester products from Image Wear, SOL | Medium | Catalog review or inquiry |
| Cleanroom carbon fiber compatibility | Medium | Technical inquiry |
| Updated disposal data (SYKE 2021 is 4 years old) | Low | Government inquiry |

### What This Research Cannot Resolve

These require **direct industry engagement**, not desk research:

1. Specific 100% PET product SKUs from manufacturers
2. Operational contacts at end-user organizations
3. Rester's actual uncommitted capacity
4. Pricing and volume commitments
5. Sample requests and quality verification
