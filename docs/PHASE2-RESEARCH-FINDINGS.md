# Phase 2 Research Findings

**Research Date:** 2025-11-29 (Updated 2025-12-16)
**Purpose:** Close gaps identified in Critical Assessment
**Methodology:** Cited web research with source verification

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 research addressed the critical gaps identified in our delivery assessment. Key findings include **verification of 3 previously unverified contacts**, discovery of a **critical material compatibility issue with Lindström**, and confirmation that **Rester's capacity may be partially locked** by existing partnerships.

### Critical Discovery

**Lindström uses 65:35 poly-cotton blends — NOT 100% polyester.** This means their 400 t/year end-of-life volume is NOT suitable for FabricAir's requirements. This finding significantly impacts our Top 10 ranking.

## 1. Contact Verification Results

### Verified Contacts

| Organization | Contact | Role | Email | Status |
|--------------|---------|------|-------|--------|
| Orion | Carolina Sved | Head of Indirect & Sustainable Procurement | carolina.sved@orion.fi | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Valio | Hanna Hiekkamies | SVP Group Sustainability | hanna.hiekkamies@valio.fi | ✅ VERIFIED |
| KONE | Hanna Uusitalo | VP Environment & Sustainability | hanna.uusitalo@kone.com | ✅ VERIFIED |

### Contact Level Assessment

**Important Finding:** All three verified contacts are at **strategic/executive level**, not operational level. These are sustainability directors, NOT the people who manage day-to-day textile waste disposal.

| Contact | Level | Appropriate For |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Carolina Sved | Strategic | Partnership discussions, policy |
| Hanna Hiekkamies | Strategic | ESG initiatives, strategic sourcing |
| Hanna Uusitalo | Strategic | Environmental strategy |

**Gap Remains:** We still need operational contacts (facilities managers, waste coordinators) for actual textile disposal decisions.

### Investors (Cited)

| Investor | Type | Source |
|----------|------|--------|
| Touchpoint | Founder, majority owner | [Tesi Investment](https://tesi.fi/en/article/rester-article/) |
| Lindström Group | Strategic investor (led summer 2022 round) | [Tesi Investment](https://tesi.fi/en/article/rester-article/) |

| Besodos Investors | Financial investor | [Tesi Investment](https://tesi.fi/en/article/rester-article/) |

### Capacity Lock Risk: CONFIRMED

"The round was led by Lindström Group, **one of Rester's largest customers**" ([Tesi](https://tesi.fi/en/article/rester-article/)). Lindström's dual role as investor AND customer creates significant capacity lock risk.

### Future Expansion Plans

"In addition to the current plant, which serves the Nordic countries, Rester is planning plants in continental Europe. They could be identical to the existing plant or tailored to the target market." ([Tesi](https://tesi.fi/en/article/rester-article/))

### EU Horizon Project

Rester is participating in **PESCO-UP** EU Horizon project with 19 other organizations, focusing on transforming mixed polyester/cotton waste into high-quality materials. This may expand their capabilities for handling blends.

## 4. Material Composition Findings

### Critical Finding: Lindström Material

**Lindström workwear uses 65:35 poly-cotton blends — NOT 100% polyester.**

This finding was confirmed through web research. The implication is significant:

| Previous Assumption | Reality |
|---------------------|---------|
| Lindström provides 400 t/year of recyclable material | Material is 65:35 blend, NOT suitable for FabricAir |
| Lindström is a priority volume source | Must be reclassified as incompatible feedstock |

### Cleanroom Garment Specifications

| Provider | Material | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Standard cleanroom | 99% polyester + 1-6% polyester/carbon | Carbon for ESD protection |
| Lindström cleanroom | Meets EN-14065, ISO 14644 | Pharmaceutical grade |
| Elis cleanroom | Sterile garments | Operates in Finland |

**Implication:** Cleanroom garments typically contain 1-6% carbon fiber for anti-static properties. Need to verify if this is compatible with FabricAir's requirements.

### Touchpoint ReTouch Fabric

Touchpoint's circular fabric **ReTouch** contains recycled cotton/polyester — it is a blend, not 100% polyester. However, Touchpoint manages workwear from multiple sectors, some of which may be 100% PET.

---

## 5. Competitive Intelligence

### Pure Waste Finland

| Factor | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Source material | Cutting waste from India |
| Why not Finland? | "If we wanted to manufacture fabrics in Finland, we would have to use used clothes as raw material. However, that is not yet possible in terms of quality" — Anders Bengs, Founder |
| Competing for Finnish feedstock? | **NO** — They source from India |

**Strategic Implication:** Pure Waste is NOT competing for Finnish post-consumer polyester. They use pre-consumer cutting waste from Indian factories.

### Other Potential Competitors

| Company | Focus | Threat Level |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Reima | Consumer recycled polyester | Low (different market) |
| Marimekko | Design focus, Rester customer | Low (not feedstock competitor) |

### Pharma/Cleanroom Workforce (for volume estimation)

| Orion Corporation | ~3,700-4,000 | [Orion Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Corporation_(Finnish_company)) |
| Finnish clothing industry | ~2,000 | [Kolfox](https://kolfox.com/clothing-manufacturers-supplier-in-finland/) |

### What We Still Don't Know

1. **How much of 85,770 t/year is workwear vs consumer?** (Estimate: 10-15%)
2. **How much workwear is 100% polyester vs blends?** (Estimate: 20-30%)
3. **How much 100% polyester is white?** (Estimate: 30-50% in cleanroom/pharma)
4. **What volume does Rester have available (not committed)?** (Unknown - requires direct inquiry)

### Best Estimate for 100% White Polyester (Updated)

| Sector | Estimated Volume | Calculation Basis | Confidence |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Cleanroom/Pharma | 50-150 t/year | 5,400 employees × ~10kg/yr × 100% PET | Medium |
| Healthcare (white) | 200-400 t/year | Hospital rental 1,330t × 20% white PET | Low |
| Food processing (white) | 50-150 t/year | ~5% of rental market, white | Low |
| **Total accessible** | **300-700 t/year** | | Low |

**Key Insight:** Previous estimate of "5,000-10,000 tonnes" included blended materials. Revised to 300-700 t/year for 100% white polyester specifically.

## 8. Key Questions for FabricAir First Meeting

### Questions for Rester

1. "What volume of **100% white polyester** do you currently process?"
2. "What is your available capacity not committed to existing partners?"
3. "What feedstock sources provide the **highest quality 100% PET**?"
4. "Can you provide fiber specifications and samples?"
5. "Is cleanroom polyester with 1-6% carbon fiber acceptable in your process?"

### Questions for Puro

1. "What percentage of your healthcare textiles are **100% polyester**?"
2. "What is your annual volume of **white** polyester garments?"
3. "How do you currently dispose of end-of-life textiles?"
4. "Would you be interested in a direct partnership for textile recycling?"

2. "What is your annual volume of end-of-life cleanroom garments?"
3. "What is the material composition (including ESD carbon fiber)?"
4. "Can we connect with your facilities management team?"

---

## 9. Remaining Gaps

### Still Unresolved

| Gap | Priority | Effort to Close |
|-----|----------|-----------------|
| Operational waste contacts at Orion, Valio, KONE | High | Requires direct outreach |
| Rester available capacity (not committed) | High | Requires direct conversation |
| 100% polyester products from Image Wear, SOL | Medium | Catalog review or inquiry |
| Cleanroom carbon fiber compatibility | Medium | Technical inquiry |
| Updated disposal data (SYKE 2021 is 4 years old) | Low | Government inquiry |

### What This Research Cannot Resolve

These require **direct industry engagement**, not desk research:

1. Specific 100% PET product SKUs from manufacturers
2. Operational contacts at end-user organizations
3. Rester's actual uncommitted capacity
4. Pricing and volume commitments
5. Sample requests and quality verification

| Rester capacity detail | "6,000-12,000 t/year" | 6,000 Rester + 5,000 LSJH = 11,000 total |

### Remaining Gap (20%)

| Gap | Why It Can't Be Closed by Desk Research |
|-----|----------------------------------------|
| Operational contacts at end-users | Requires direct outreach to facilities managers |
| Rester uncommitted capacity | Confidential business information |
| Specific 100% PET product SKUs | Not published online |
| Pricing and volume terms | Requires commercial negotiation |
