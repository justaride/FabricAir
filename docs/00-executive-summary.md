## Recommended Engagement Strategy

### Phase 1: Establish Partnerships (Week 1-2)
1. Contact **Touchpoint** (Noora Salonoja) - gateway to Rester
2. Contact **LSJH** (Anna Garton) - sorted polyester streams
3. Contact **Rester** - technical partnership discussion

### Phase 2: Expand Volume (Week 3-4)
1. Contact **Lindström** (Kati Pallasaho) - large-scale workwear
2. Contact **HUS/Sairaalapesula** - healthcare textiles
3. Contact **Image Wear** - workwear manufacturer

### Phase 3: Pilot Development
1. Request material samples
2. Define collection logistics
3. Establish pilot with 1-2 partners

## Regulatory Context

| Milestone | Date | Impact |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Mandatory textile collection | Jan 2023 | Finland 2 years ahead of EU |
| EU Waste Framework update | 2025 | Harmonized rules |
| Finnish EPR implementation | 2027-2028 | Producer responsibility |

---

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Competition for feedstock | Early partnership agreements |
| Quality variability | Rester pre-sorting capability |
| Blend contamination | Specify 100% PET requirement |
| Regulatory changes | Monitor EPR development |
