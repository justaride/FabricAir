# FabricAir Research Context Document

**Purpose:** Provide complete context for desktop research to uncover additional information for the FabricAir circular polyester challenge.

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-16

## 1. The Company: FabricAir

**What they do:** FabricAir (Denmark) manufactures fabric-based ventilation ducts — textile tubes that distribute air in large buildings (warehouses, factories, sports halls, food processing). Their product replaces traditional metal ductwork.

**Their product requires:**
- Woven polyester or polyamide fabric
- ~300 g/m² weight
- Preferably white (for cleanroom/food applications)
- **100% polyester (PET) or 100% polyamide** — no blends acceptable

**Their sustainability goal:** Transition from virgin polyester to **recycled polyester (rPET)** to create circular ventilation textiles. This aligns with EU Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) requirements coming into force 2027-2028.

## 2. The Challenge We're Solving

### Core Question
**Where can FabricAir source high-quality recycled polyester fiber in the Nordic region (Finland, Sweden, Norway)?**

### Why Nordic?
- FabricAir is based in Denmark
- Nordic Innovation funded this research through the Nordic Circular Construction (NCC) project
- Proximity matters for logistics and supply chain sustainability
- Nordic countries have advanced textile collection infrastructure

### The Supply Chain Gap

```
[Textile Waste Sources] → [Collection] → [Sorting] → [RECYCLING] → [rPET Fiber] → [FabricAir]
                                                          ↑
                                               THIS IS THE BOTTLENECK
```

**The problem:** Nordic countries collect textile waste, but almost none is recycled into fiber. Most is:
- Incinerated (60%)
- Exported (30%)
- Landfilled (5%)
- Recycled (<1%)

## 3. Critical Technical Constraint

### FabricAir ONLY Accepts 100% Pure Materials

| Acceptable | NOT Acceptable |
|------------|----------------|
| 100% Polyester (PET) | 65/35 Polyester/Cotton blends |
| 100% Polyamide | 50/50 blends |
| 100% rPET or rPA fiber | Mixed fiber textiles |
| White/light colors preferred | |

**Why this matters:** Most Nordic workwear (the main textile waste stream) uses **65% polyester / 35% cotton blends**. This is the standard for durability and comfort. But these blends CANNOT be used by FabricAir.

**The implication:** We're not looking for ALL recycled polyester — we're looking specifically for **100% pure PET or polyamide sources**, which dramatically narrows the available supply.

---

## 4. What We're Looking For

### Primary: Recyclers Who Output rPET Fiber

Companies that can take post-consumer polyester textiles and convert them into fiber suitable for textile manufacturing.

**Technologies:**
- **Mechanical recycling** — shredding/defibration (lower quality, operational now)
- **Chemical recycling** — depolymerization to monomers (virgin quality, mostly pre-commercial)

### Secondary: Feedstock Sources

Companies/sectors that generate **100% polyester or polyamide** waste streams:

| Sector | Why Relevant | Material Type |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Cleanroom/Pharma** | Strict hygiene = 100% PET garments | White, pure PET |
| **Food processing** | Hygiene requirements | Often white, may be blends |
| **Healthcare** | High volumes | Mixed — verify composition |
| **Industrial laundries** | Aggregators of workwear | Mixed — verify composition |
| **Cutting waste** | Pre-consumer, clean | Pure, single-material |

### Tertiary: Infrastructure

- Sorting facilities (separate PET from blends)
- Collection networks
- Logistics providers

## 5. What We've Found So Far

### Nordic Recyclers (3 Identified)

| Recycler | Country | Technology | Capacity | Status |
|----------|---------|------------|----------|--------|
| **Rester** | Finland | Mechanical | 6-12k t/yr | **Operational NOW** |
| **Rewin** | Sweden | Chemical | 20k t/yr | Oct 2027 launch |
| **NTG** | Norway | Defibration | 30k t/yr | ~2027 |

### Key Finding: Rester is the Only Current Option

Rester (Paimio, Finland) is the **only operational textile-to-fiber recycler** in the Nordics today. However:

- **Risk:** Lindström (Finland's largest textile rental company) is Rester's 2nd largest shareholder
- **Concern:** Lindström may have locked significant capacity for their own recycling needs
- **Unknown:** How much capacity is actually available to new customers like FabricAir?

### Volume Reality Check

| Metric | Initial Estimate | Revised Estimate |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Total Nordic textile waste | 250,000 t/yr | 250,000 t/yr |
| Workwear/uniform portion | 50,000 t/yr | 50,000 t/yr |
| **100% PET portion** | 5-10k t/yr | **350-1,000 t/yr** |

**Why the dramatic reduction?** Most workwear is 65/35 blends, not pure PET. The 100% PET sources are limited to:
- Cleanroom garments (~50-150 t/yr)
- Specific healthcare items
- Pre-consumer cutting waste
- Select industrial uniforms

## 6. The 6 Research Questions Framework

Our research is structured around 6 questions (originally for Finland, extended to Sweden/Norway):

### Q1: Sectors & Actors
**Question:** Which sectors generate polyester textile waste suitable for FabricAir?

**Key sectors identified:**
- Cleanroom/pharmaceutical (best: 100% white PET)

- Industrial laundries (aggregators)
- Hotels (bedding — 50/50 blend, future potential)

### Q2: Stakeholders
**Question:** Who are the key stakeholders in Nordic textile recycling?

**Stakeholder map:**

## 10. Success Criteria

### What Would Complete This Research?

1. **Confirmed available capacity** at Rester (not locked by Lindström)
2. **Validated 100% PET volumes** from at least 3 sources
3. **Pricing indication** for rPET fiber
4. **Updated statistics** (2023/2024 data)
5. **Additional 100% PET sources** beyond cleanroom

### What Would Be a Breakthrough?

- Discovery of large 100% PET waste stream we haven't identified
- New recycler entering the market sooner than Rewin/NTG
- Evidence that Rester has significant uncommitted capacity
- Alternative technology that can separate PET from 65/35 blends economically

---

## Summary: The Research Challenge

**FabricAir needs:**
- 100% polyester fiber
- From post-consumer/post-industrial sources
- In the Nordic region
- At commercial volumes

**The constraint:**
- Most textile waste is 65/35 blends (NOT usable)
- Only ~1% of Nordic textile waste is 100% PET
- One recycler operational today (Rester), and capacity may be locked

**The opportunity:**
- Cleanroom/pharma sector produces ideal material (100% white PET)
- EPR regulations will drive more collection and recycling infrastructure
- Two major recyclers coming online 2027-2029 (Rewin, NTG)
- First-mover advantage for FabricAir in securing supply agreements

**Research goal:**
- Validate existing findings
- Uncover additional 100% PET sources
- Identify new recyclers or capacity expansions
- Find pathway to FabricAir's circular textile goal
