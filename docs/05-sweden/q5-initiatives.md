# Q5: Initiatives — Sweden

> What public and private initiatives exist in Sweden for polyester collection and reuse?

---

## Key Finding

**Sweden has strong research infrastructure and the world's first automated textile sorting (SIPTex), but lacks domestic polyester recycling until Rewin launches (~2027).**

**⚠️ Critical Updates (Dec 2025):**
- **SIPTex being sold** — Sysav divesting due to lack of outlet markets
- **Rewin pilot permits secured** — Malmö facility moving to commissioning

---

## Initiative Overview

| Initiative | Type | Status | Impact |
|------------|------|--------|--------|
| **Rewin** | Private | Development | Game-changer (20k t/yr) |
| **SIPTex** | Public-Private | Operational | World-first sorting |
| **RE:Source** | Public | Operational | Major funding |
| **Textile 2030** | Industry | Operational | Roadmap |

## Major Initiatives

### Rewin Project (CRITICAL)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Lead | Wargön Innovation |
| Technology | Chemical fiber-to-fiber recycling (catalytic glycolysis) |
| Full-scale capacity | 20,000 tonnes/year |
| Pilot capacity | ~20 tonnes/year |
| Project timeline | Oct 2023 – Oct 2027 |
| Funding | Swedish Energy Agency |
| Full-scale location | Vargön (near Gothenburg, industrial symbiosis with Vargön Alloys) |
| **Pilot location** | **Sege Industrial Park, Malmö** |

**Status (Dec 2025):**
- ✅ **Pilot plant permits secured** (building + environmental)
- ✅ Commissioning targeted autumn 2025, operations before end 2025
- ⚠️ Full-scale "Oct 2027" is project end date, not confirmed launch

**Feedstock Requirements:**
- **≥80% polyester content**
- No requirements for color or print
- Accepts buttons/zippers (no pre-removal needed)
- Sources: textile sorters, industrial production waste
- **100% polyester is acceptable** (not limited to blends)

**Output:** Virgin-quality polyester granulate, suitable for new production

**Partners:**
- Gina Tricot, KappAhl (fashion retail)
- Helly Hansen (outdoor/workwear)
- Dual Borgstena, ScandCycle, National

**Contact:** Joel Arnoldsson — Innovation Manager, Wargön Innovation

### SIPTex — ⚠️ BEING DIVESTED

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Operator | Sysav (Malmö) |
| Technology | NIR + visual spectroscopy |
| Capacity | 24,000 tonnes/year (~30% of Swedish textile waste) |
| Status | ⚠️ **Sysav divesting** |
| Achievement | World's first automated textile sorting |

**⚠️ Critical Update (Dec 2025):**

Sysav announced it is **starting a process to sell/divest SIPTex:**
- Investment assumed domestic offtake markets (2019 decision)
- **Since 2024:** No stable outlet for sorted fractions
- **~1,200 tonnes unsorted textiles** sitting at facility at decision time
- Sysav does NOT expect market improvement during 2026-2027
- Textile EPR (2028) will change roles/responsibilities

**How it works:**
1. Textiles fed onto conveyor
2. NIR identifies fiber composition
3. Air jets separate by type
4. >90% purity for polyester fraction

**Implication:** SIPTex's future role depends on who acquires it and whether recyclers/PROs can contract stable offtake chains.
