# Q5: Initiatives — Sweden

> What public and private initiatives exist in Sweden for polyester collection and reuse?

---

## Key Finding

**Sweden has strong research infrastructure and the world's first automated textile sorting (SIPTex), but lacks domestic polyester recycling until Rewin launches in October 2027.**

---

## Initiative Overview

| Initiative | Type | Status | Impact |
|------------|------|--------|--------|
| **Rewin** | Private | Development | Game-changer (20k t/yr) |
| **SIPTex** | Public-Private | Operational | World-first sorting |
| **RE:Source** | Public | Operational | Major funding |
| **Textile 2030** | Industry | Operational | Roadmap |

## Major Initiatives

### Rewin Project (CRITICAL)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Lead | Wargön Innovation |
| Technology | Chemical fiber-to-fiber recycling |
| Capacity | 20,000 tonnes/year |
| Timeline | October 2027 |
| Funding | Swedish Energy Agency |
| Location | Vargön (near Gothenburg) |

**Partners:**
- Gina Tricot (fashion retail)
- KappAhl (fashion retail)
- Helly Hansen (outdoor/workwear)

**Achievement (October 2024):** Successfully extracted high-quality polyester from complex three-fiber blends.

**Contact:** Joel Arnoldsson — Innovation Manager, Wargön Innovation

### SIPTex (Operational)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Operator | Sysav (Malmö) |
| Technology | NIR + visual spectroscopy |
| Capacity | 24,000 tonnes/year |
| Status | Operational since 2023 |
| Achievement | World's first automated textile sorting |

**How it works:**
1. Textiles fed onto conveyor
2. NIR identifies fiber composition
3. Air jets separate by type
4. >90% purity for polyester fraction

**Current limitation:** Sorted polyester exported (no domestic recycler until 2027)
