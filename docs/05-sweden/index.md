## Q1: Sectors & Actors

> **What sectors and actors in Sweden use high-quality polyester fibers?**

### Answer

The Swedish textile services market is **€560 million/year** (SEK 6.47 billion), with workwear representing ~SEK 2.4 billion (~€205M). However, most workwear uses 65/35 poly-cotton blends which are NOT suitable for FabricAir.

### Best Sources for 100% White Polyester/Polyamide

| Priority | Sector | White % | 100% PET/PA | Key Players |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Pharma/Cleanroom | >90% | Yes | AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Octapharma |
| 2 | Healthcare | ~60% | Often blends | Region Stockholm, Textilia |
| 3 | Food Processing | 50-70% | Mixed | Arla, Orkla |

### Key Finding

**AstraZeneca Södertälje is the prime source** — ~5,000 employees producing 40% of AstraZeneca's global volume, using 100% polyester cleanroom garments.

## Q2: Value Chain Stakeholders

> **Who are the main stakeholders in production, use, and reuse of polyester textiles in Sweden?**

### Answer

Sweden's textile ecosystem includes major European players with sophisticated infrastructure. The market lacks domestic polyester recycling until 2027.

### Key Stakeholders by Role

| Role | Key Players | Market Position |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Sorting** | SIPTex (Sysav) | World-first automated sorting (24k t/yr) |
| **Recycling (2027)** | Rewin/Wargön | Chemical recycling (20k t/yr target) |
| **Textile Services** | Elis, Textilia, CWS | Control majority of workwear lifecycle |
| **Research** | RISE, Chalmers | Technology development |

### Critical Gap

```
Sweden has sorting (SIPTex) but NO polyester recycling
Until Rewin launches (Oct 2027), polyester must go to Finland (Rester)
```

## Q3: Disposal & Reuse

> **How are polyester textiles disposed of in Sweden, and what are reuse levels?**

### Answer

Sweden processes **60-80,000 tonnes/year** of textile waste with less than 1% going to material recycling.

### Current Disposal Routes

| Route | Percentage | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Incineration | ~50% | Energy recovery |
| Export | ~35% | Sorted for reuse abroad |
| Reuse (domestic) | ~14% | Second-hand market |
| **Material Recycling** | **<1%** | SIPTex sorting only |

### Key Finding

- **Landfill banned since 2002** — All waste goes to incineration or export
- **SIPTex operational** — 24,000 t/yr sorting capacity, but recycling goes abroad
- **Renewcell bankruptcy** — Cellulose recycling collapsed Feb 2024 (acquired by Altor)

## Q4: Regulations

> **What regulations govern polyester textile disposal/reuse, and how will they evolve?**

### Answer

Sweden implements EU textile regulations with mandatory collection starting January 2025 and full EPR by April 2028.

### Regulatory Timeline

| Date | Regulation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| 2002 | Landfill ban | In force |
| Jan 2025 | Mandatory collection | In force |
| 2026-27 | Digital Product Passport | Upcoming |
| **Apr 2028** | **EPR full implementation** | **Upcoming** |

### Key Finding

**Sweden follows EU timeline closely** — No early adoption like Finland. EPR will shift costs to producers, creating incentive for recycled content.

## Q5: Initiatives

> **What public and private initiatives exist in Sweden for polyester collection and reuse?**

### Answer

Sweden has strong research infrastructure and the world's first automated textile sorting, but lacks domestic polyester recycling.

### Active Initiatives

| Initiative | Type | Status | Role |
|------------|------|--------|------|
| **SIPTex** | Public-Private | Operational | Automated sorting (24k t/yr) |
| **Rewin** | Private | Development | Chemical recycling (2027) |
| **RE:Source** | Public | Operational | SEK 50M/year funding |
| **Textile 2030** | Industry | Operational | Sustainability roadmap |

### Key Discovery: Rewin Project

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Lead | Wargön Innovation |
| Capacity | 20,000 t/yr |
| Technology | Chemical fiber-to-fiber |
| Timeline | October 2027 |
| Partners | Gina Tricot, KappAhl, Helly Hansen |

**Achievement:** Successfully extracted polyester from complex three-fiber blends (October 2024).

## Summary: Key Answers

| Question | Key Answer |
|----------|------------|
| Q1 | Target cleanroom/pharma (AstraZeneca); avoid 65/35 blends |
| Q2 | SIPTex sorts, but no domestic recycling until Rewin (2027) |
| Q3 | 60-80k t/year waste; <1% recycled; landfill banned |
| Q4 | EPR April 2028; collection mandatory Jan 2025 |
| Q5 | Rewin is the key — 20k t/yr chemical recycling by Oct 2027 |
| Q6 | Rewin + Elis + AstraZeneca are priorities |

### Critical Discovery

**Rewin project (Wargön Innovation)** developing 20,000 t/yr chemical polyester recycling by October 2027 — this will be Sweden's first domestic capability.

### Supply Chain Options

**Option A (2024-2027):** Cross-border to Finnish Rester
```
Sweden cleanroom → SIPTex sorting → Rester (Finland) → FabricAir
```

**Option B (2027+):** Domestic Swedish recycling
```
Sweden textiles → SIPTex sorting → Rewin recycling → FabricAir
```
