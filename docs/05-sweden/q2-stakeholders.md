# Q2: Value Chain Stakeholders — Sweden

> Who are the main stakeholders in production, use, and reuse of polyester textiles in Sweden?

---

## Key Finding

**Sweden has world-leading sorting infrastructure (SIPTex) but NO domestic polyester recycling until Rewin launches in October 2027.** Current flows go to incineration or export.

## Value Chain Overview

```
Production → Use → Collection → Sorting → Recycling → New Products
                                  ↓
                            [SIPTex]     [Gap until 2027]
                            24k t/yr         ↓
                                         [Rewin]
                                         20k t/yr (Oct 2027)
```

## Strategic Implications

1. **No current recycling partner** — Must use Rester (Finland) until 2027
2. **SIPTex is operational** — Sorting infrastructure ready
3. **Rewin is the future** — Engage now for 2027 partnership
4. **Elis controls cleanroom** — Key feedstock aggregator
