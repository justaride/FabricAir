# Q4: Regulations — Sweden

> What regulations govern polyester textile disposal/reuse in Sweden, and how will they evolve?

---

## Key Finding

**Sweden follows EU textile regulations closely with mandatory collection from January 2025 and full EPR by April 2028.** Landfill has been banned since 2002.

---

## Current Regulatory Framework

| Regulation | Status | Impact |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Landfill ban | In force (2002) | All textile waste to incineration or recycling |
| Waste hierarchy | In force | Prevention > Reuse > Recycling > Recovery |
| Producer responsibility (general) | In force | Extends to textiles in 2028 |

---

## Regulatory Timeline

| Date | Regulation | Status | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|--------|
| 2002 | Landfill ban | ✅ In force | No textile landfilling |
| Jan 2025 | Mandatory collection | ✅ In force | Municipalities must collect |
| 2026-27 | Digital Product Passport | Upcoming | Traceability requirements |
| **Apr 2028** | **EPR full implementation** | **Upcoming** | Producer fees, recycling targets |
| 2030+ | Recycled content mandates | Expected | Minimum rPET requirements |

---

## EU Framework (Applies to Sweden)

### EU Textile Strategy (March 2022)

| Requirement | Timeline |
|-------------|----------|
| Separate collection | January 2025 |
| EPR schemes | April 2028 |
| Ecodesign requirements | 2026+ |
| Digital Product Passport | 2026-2027 |

### Waste Framework Directive

- Textile collection mandatory from 2025
- Member states must ensure collection infrastructure
- Prioritize reuse over recycling

---

## Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)

### What EPR Means

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Who pays** | Producers/importers of textiles |
| **For what** | End-of-life collection and treatment |
| **Fee structure** | Based on volume and recyclability |
| **Targets** | Recycling percentages (TBD) |

### Expected Fee Structure

| Product Type | Expected Fee Range |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Easily recyclable | Lower fees |
| Blended materials | Higher fees |
| Hazardous treatments | Premium fees |

### Implications

- Companies using 100% PET may benefit from lower fees
- Blend-heavy producers face higher costs
- Incentive to design for recyclability

---

## Chemical Regulations

### REACH Compliance

| Substance | Restriction |
|-----------|-------------|
| PFAS | Phase-out in progress |
| Flame retardants | Restricted |
| Heavy metals | Prohibited |

### Swedish Chemicals Tax

- Additional taxation on hazardous chemicals
- Applies to certain textile treatments
- Incentivizes safer alternatives

---

## Standards and Certifications

### Relevant Standards

| Standard | Purpose | Relevance |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| GRS | Global Recycled Standard | Required for rPET claims |
| OEKO-TEX | Chemical safety | Consumer textiles |
| Nordic Swan | Sustainability | Nordic market |
| EU Ecolabel | Environmental | Preferred for public procurement |

### GRS Requirements

| Requirement | Threshold |
|-------------|-----------|
| Recycled content | ≥50% for consumer logo |
| Chain of custody | Full traceability |
| Chemical restrictions | Comprehensive list |
| Social requirements | Labor standards |

---

## Public Procurement

### Sustainability Requirements

| Sector | Common Requirements |
|--------|---------------------|
| Healthcare | Ecolabel certification |
| Government | Environmental criteria |
| Municipalities | Local sustainability goals |

### Implications

- Recycled content increasingly required in tenders
- Certification becoming table stakes
- Opportunity for circular suppliers

---

## Enforcement

### Current Enforcement

| Area | Enforcement Level |
|------|-------------------|
| Landfill ban | High |
| Collection requirements | Medium (new) |
| EPR | Not yet applicable |
| Chemical restrictions | High |

### Naturvårdsverket Role

- Environmental agency
- Sets EPR framework
- Monitors compliance
- Issues guidance

---

## Key Contacts

| Organization | Contact | Role |
|--------------|---------|------|
| Naturvårdsverket | Yvonne Augustsson | EPR policy |
| Kemikalieinspektionen | — | Chemical regulations |
| Länsstyrelserna | Regional | Local enforcement |

---

## Strategic Implications

1. **2025 Collection:** Increased feedstock availability
2. **2028 EPR:** Creates financial incentive for recycling
3. **GRS Certification:** Essential for commercial credibility
4. **Fee Avoidance:** 100% PET may get favorable treatment

---

## Comparison with Nordic Countries

| Country | Collection Start | EPR Date | Status |
|---------|------------------|----------|--------|
| Finland | Jan 2023 | 2027-28 | 2 years ahead |
| **Sweden** | **Jan 2025** | **Apr 2028** | **Following EU** |
| Norway | Jan 2025 | Under review | Uncertain |
