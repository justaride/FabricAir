# Q3: Disposal & Reuse — Sweden

> How are polyester textiles disposed of in Sweden, and what are reuse levels?

---

## Key Finding

**Sweden generates 60-80,000 tonnes/year of textile waste with <1% going to material recycling.** Landfill has been banned since 2002, so waste goes to incineration or export.

---

## Waste Generation

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total textile waste | 60-80k t/yr | Naturvårdsverket |
| Per capita | 8-11 kg/yr | National statistics |
| Post-consumer | ~85% | Estimate |
| Pre-consumer | ~15% | Manufacturing waste |

---

## Current Disposal Routes

| Route | Percentage | Volume | Destination |
|-------|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Incineration** | ~50% | 30-40k t | Energy recovery |
| **Export** | ~35% | 21-28k t | Eastern Europe, Africa |
| **Reuse (domestic)** | ~14% | 8-11k t | Second-hand market |
| **Material Recycling** | **<1%** | <800 t | Downcycling |

### Fiber-to-Fiber Recycling

**Current:** Essentially zero for polyester
**2027+:** Rewin targeting 20,000 t/yr

2027+: SIPTex → Rewin → rPET fiber

## Key Infrastructure

### SIPTex (Malmö)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Capacity | 24,000 t/yr |
| Technology | NIR + visual spectroscopy |
| Purity | >90% polyester identification |
| Status | Operational |

**Current output:** Sorted fractions exported or incinerated (no domestic recycler)

### Renewcell (Kristinehamn) — CLOSED

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Technology | Cellulose recycling |
| Status | **Bankrupt Feb 2024** |
| Acquired by | Altor (June 2024) |
| Note | Was cellulose only, NOT polyester |

## Professional Textile Waste

### Workwear End-of-Life

| Source | Estimated Volume | Current Fate |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| Healthcare | 3-5k t/yr | Incineration |
| Industrial | 5-8k t/yr | Incineration |
| Hospitality | 2-3k t/yr | Mixed |
| Cleanroom | 0.5-1k t/yr | Incineration |

### Textile Service Companies

| Company | End-of-Life Volume | Disposition |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Elis | ~2,000 t/yr | Incineration |
| Textilia | ~1,000 t/yr | Incineration |
| CWS | ~500 t/yr | Incineration |

---

## Reuse Infrastructure

### Collection Networks

| Organization | Coverage | Volume |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| Human Bridge | 118 municipalities | Major |
| Myrorna | Nationwide | Major |
| Röda Korset | Nationwide | Significant |
| Emmaus | Regional | Moderate |

### Second-Hand Market

- Strong domestic market
- Export to Eastern Europe
- Quality items resold domestically
- Lower quality exported

---

## Barriers to Recycling

| Barrier | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| No domestic polyester recycler | Critical |
| Mixed fiber compositions | High |
| Collection fragmentation | Medium |
| Sorting costs | Medium |
| Quality variability | Medium |

---

## Future Changes

### EPR Implementation (April 2028)

- Producer responsibility for end-of-life
- Mandatory collection infrastructure
- Recycling targets expected
- Fees based on recyclability

### Rewin Launch (October 2027)

- First domestic polyester recycling
- 20,000 t/yr capacity
- Chemical fiber-to-fiber
- Will absorb SIPTex polyester fraction

---

## Implications for FabricAir

1. **Current:** Professional workwear goes to incineration — opportunity to redirect
2. **SIPTex:** Sorting available, but output currently wasted
3. **2027+:** Rewin will create domestic recycling loop
4. **Strategy:** Engage Elis/Textilia now, redirect to Rewin in 2027
