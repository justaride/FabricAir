# Q1: Sectors & Actors — Sweden

> What sectors and actors in Sweden use high-quality polyester fibers (durable uniforms, workwear, preferably white)?

---

## Key Finding

**The cleanroom/pharmaceutical sector is the only reliable source of 100% white polyester/polyamide in Sweden.** Most other workwear uses 65/35 poly-cotton blends which are NOT suitable for FabricAir.
