# FabricAir Nordic Circular Polyester Research Platform

---

## Project Report

### Genesis

This research platform emerged from a strategic imperative: FabricAir, a Danish manufacturer of textile-based ventilation systems serving 120+ countries, sought to transform its supply chain from virgin polyester to 100% circular sourcing. The question was not whether to pursue circularity—the direction was clear—but how to build a reliable, scalable supply of recycled polyester fiber across the Nordic region.

The project was commissioned through the **Nordic Circular Construction (NCC)** initiative, a collaborative program funded by Nordic Innovation supporting 16 companies in accelerating circular construction solutions. Natural State AS coordinated the effort, connecting FabricAir's technical requirements with research capabilities to map the Nordic textile recycling landscape.

### The Mission

The core mission was precise: identify and map companies in Finland, Sweden, and Norway specializing in collection of used polyester fibers for recycling, with capacity to deliver high volume, high quality raw materials meeting FabricAir's specifications:

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| Material | 100% Polyester (PET) or 100% Polyamide |
| Weight | ~300 g/m² |
| Color | White preferred |
| Source | Durable workwear, uniforms, cleanroom garments |
| NOT suitable | Polyester/cotton blends (65/35) |

This final specification—the incompatibility of 65/35 poly-cotton blends—would prove central to the research findings, as it eliminated the majority of workwear streams and directed focus toward specialized sectors.

## Research Framework

### The Six Questions

The research was structured around six interconnected questions, each building upon the previous to create a comprehensive market intelligence picture:

| Question | Focus | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Q1** | What sectors use high-quality polyester? | Sector map with volume estimates |
| **Q2** | Who are the main stakeholders? | Value chain analysis |
| **Q3** | How are textiles disposed today? | Material flow diagram |
| **Q4** | What regulations govern disposal? | Regulatory timeline |
| **Q5** | What initiatives exist? | Program inventory |
| **Q6** | Top 10 sources with contacts | Prioritized stakeholder list |

This framework ensured systematic coverage while maintaining practical focus. Each question answered informed the next, culminating in Q6's actionable stakeholder recommendations.

### Methodology

The research employed a structured verification protocol across three priority tiers:

**P1 (Critical):** Infrastructure capacity, recycler operations, market statistics
**P2 (High):** Regulatory timelines, contact verification, sector analysis
**P3 (Supporting):** Competitive intelligence, pricing data, standards frameworks

Each claim was traced to primary sources where possible, cross-referenced against multiple documents, and marked with verification status. Over the course of the research, **30+ source documents** were analyzed and **50+ claims verified** across the three Nordic countries.

## Discovery Journey

### Finland: The Foundation

Finland served as the primary research focus, with the deepest investigation across all six questions. The research revealed a market with significant volume but limited infrastructure:

- **85,770 tonnes/year** of textile waste generated
- **<1%** currently recycled fiber-to-fiber
- **€350-450 million** textile services market
- **Mandatory collection** since January 2023 (2 years ahead of EU)

**Critical Discovery:** In April 2024, LSJH cancelled its planned €20.5 million Turku recycling facility. In October 2025, LSJH announced outsourcing textile sorting to Turun Ekotori (2026), stepping back from textile operations entirely. This fundamentally altered the landscape, making **Rester** (Paimio) Finland's sole large-scale textile recycler with 6,000-12,000 tonnes/year capacity.

**Best Source Identification:** The research identified pharmaceutical and cleanroom sectors as optimal for FabricAir's requirements—>90% white, 100% polyester, consistent quality. Healthcare, while large in volume, is shifting away from white and often uses poly-cotton blends.

### Sweden: Future Capacity

Sweden research revealed a market in transition:

- **60-80,000 tonnes/year** textile waste
- **€560 million** textile services market
- **SIPTex** operational with 24,000 tonnes/year automated sorting
- **Renewcell** bankrupt (February 2024), acquired by Altor

**Critical Discovery:** The **Rewin project** at Wargön Innovation is developing a 20,000 tonnes/year chemical recycling facility targeting October 2027 launch. This represents Sweden's first domestic polyester recycling capability and could produce virgin-quality output suitable for closed-loop textile-to-textile applications.

### Norway: Largest Potential

Norway presented the most dynamic recycling landscape:

- **~100,000 tonnes/year** textile waste (highest per capita in Nordic)
- **97% exported** (minimal domestic processing)
- **€180-270 million** textile services market

**Critical Discovery:** **NTG (Norsk Tekstilgjenvinning)** emerged as the most strategically significant find. Their patented mechanical defibration technology—which cuts fibers rather than shredding them—uniquely processes poly-cotton blends while maintaining fiber quality. Current R&D facility processes 2,000 tonnes/year; scaling to **30,000 tonnes/year by approximately 2027** (accelerated timeline per Innovation Norway) would make NTG the largest Nordic recycler.

## Platform Development

### From Research to Deliverable

The research phase produced extensive documentation, but raw research does not equal a deliverable product. The platform development followed a structured approach:

**Phase 1: Data Architecture**
- YAML data files for structured information (_data/)
- Markdown documents for narrative content (docs/)
- Source document repository for audit trail (_source-documents/)
- Interconnection schema documenting dependencies

**Phase 2: Content Development**
- Six research question pages with verified findings
- Country-specific reports (Finland Q1-Q6, Sweden, Norway)
- Cross-country comparison analysis
- Contact directory with verification status
- Commercial phase implementation roadmap

**Phase 3: Platform Design**
- Professional web viewer with client-focused navigation
- Clean visual hierarchy optimized for decision-makers
- Click-to-copy functionality for all contacts
- Print-ready formatting for PDF export
- Separation of internal working documents from deliverables

### Design Principles

The platform was designed for its primary audience: FabricAir decision-makers who need to quickly understand the opportunity, identify priority contacts, and take action. This informed several key decisions:

1. **Information hierarchy:** Key metrics and recommendations first
2. **Scannable format:** Tables and bullet points over dense prose
3. **Actionable contacts:** Every email clickable and copyable
4. **Progressive disclosure:** Summary views with links to detail
5. **Internal separation:** Verification reports and working documents moved to _internal/ folder

## Key Findings

### The Opportunity

The research identified **56,000-62,000 tonnes/year** of combined recycled polyester capacity across the three Nordic countries by 2028-2029:

| Country | Partner | Capacity | Timeline | Technology |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|------------|
| Finland | Rester | 6-12k t/yr | **Now** | Mechanical |
| Norway | NTG | 30k t/yr | **~2027** | Defibration |
| Sweden | Rewin | 20k t/yr | 2027 | Chemical |

### Strategic Insights

**1. Finland First**
Rester is the only operational recycler today. However, Lindström (Finland's dominant textile service company) holds a strategic investment in Rester, potentially constraining available capacity. Early engagement is essential.

**2. Norway for Scale**
NTG offers the largest future capacity and unique poly-cotton processing capability. Their technology opens access to workwear waste streams that other recyclers cannot process. The CEO (Bent Tatsuyama Mathisen) is accessible at btm@ntgas.no.

**3. Sweden for Quality**
Rewin's chemical recycling will produce virgin-quality polyester, optimal for applications requiring highest purity. The 2027 timeline allows for relationship building before commercial operations begin.

**4. Cleanroom is Best**
Across all three countries, pharmaceutical and cleanroom sectors emerged as the optimal source for 100% white polyester: >90% white, 100% PET, consistent specifications, regular replacement cycles.

### Critical Phase 2 Findings

| Finding | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Lindström uses 65:35 blends** | 400 t/year volume INCOMPATIBLE with FabricAir |
| **Volume estimate revised** | 5-10k t/year → **350-1,000 t/year** accessible |
| **Contact level mismatch** | CEOs provided; operational contacts needed |
| **Rester capacity risk** | Lindström is 2nd largest shareholder |

These findings significantly change the strategic picture. See [Phase 2 Findings](PHASE2-RESEARCH-FINDINGS.md).

### Risk Factors

| Risk | Assessment | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Lindström stake (no exclusivity) | Medium | Engage early; develop NTG alternative |
| 65/35 blend contamination | High | Require certified 100% PET; target cleanroom |
| Lindström incompatibility | **CONFIRMED** | Volume excluded; focus on Puro, Orion |
| Quality variability | Medium | Pre-sorting specifications; incoming testing |
| rPET price premium (~160% for T2T) | Medium | Volume commitments; T2T ~€2,479/t vs virgin ~€950/t |
| Rewin delay | Medium | Maintain Rester relationship as backup |
