## SECTION 1: Rester — Critical Unknowns

### Prompt 1.1 — Rester Ownership Structure 🔴 CRITICAL
```
Research the CURRENT ownership structure of Rester Oy (Finland, textile recycling, Paimio).

VERIFIED CONTEXT:
- CEO: Jukka Pesola (Aug 2025, after €4.9M funding round)
- Lindström Group is "2nd largest shareholder" — but percentage unknown
- Strategy: "High potential industrial applications"

STILL UNKNOWN — Find:
1. What PERCENTAGE does Lindström own? (5%? 20%? 40%?)
2. Who are the other shareholders and their percentages?
3. Was the €4.9M (Jan 2025) equity or debt? What terms?
4. Does Lindström have board seats? How many?
5. Are there ANY capacity commitments tied to ownership?

WHY THIS MATTERS: If Lindström owns >30% and has capacity agreements, Rester may not have spare capacity for FabricAir.

Search: Finnish company registry (PRH/YTJ), Tesi (Finnish Industry Investment) announcements, Finnish business news (Kauppalehti, Talouselämä).
```

### Prompt 1.2 — Rester Available Capacity 🔴 CRITICAL

- Strategy shift to "high potential industrial applications"

UNKNOWN:
1. What is ACTUAL throughput in 2024? (Not claimed capacity)
2. How much is already committed to existing partners?
3. How much is AVAILABLE for new customers?
4. What minimum volume commitment would a new customer need?
5. Is 100% white polyester specifically available?
6. What is the waiting list / lead time for new partners?

KEY QUESTION: Can FabricAir get 100-500 tonnes/year allocation?

Search: Rester website, Finnish textile industry news 2024-2025, interviews with Jukka Pesola.

2. What is the annual production volume?
3. What happens to production waste (cutting scraps)?
4. What happens to end-of-life sportswear?

Note: Sportswear is often 100% nylon (polyamide) for stretch properties.
```

### Prompt 2.2 — Nordic Swimwear & Technical Textiles 🟠 HIGH
```
Research 100% polyamide sources in swimwear and technical textiles.

POLYAMIDE APPLICATIONS:
- Swimwear (typically 78-82% nylon + 18-22% elastane — may NOT qualify as 100%)
- Hosiery/stockings (often 100% nylon)
- Parachutes and technical fabrics
- Fishing nets and ropes

Find:
1. Are there any 100% polyamide textile products manufactured in Nordics?
2. What volumes of polyamide textile waste exist?
3. Where does polyamide waste currently go?
4. Are there any polyamide-to-fiber recyclers in Europe?

WARNING: Many "nylon" products contain elastane blends — verify 100% purity.
```

### Prompt 2.3 — Industrial Polyamide Textiles 🟡 MEDIUM
```
Research industrial 100% polyamide textile applications.

Potential sources:
- Tire cord fabric (nylon 6,6)
- Conveyor belts
- Airbags
- Industrial ropes and webbing

1. What industrial applications use 100% polyamide textiles?
2. What volumes are discarded annually in the Nordics?
3. How is industrial polyamide waste currently disposed?
4. Are these sources contaminated (unsuitable for recycling)?

Note: Industrial polyamide may be higher quality than consumer textiles.

## SECTION 3: Cleanroom Validation (Still Unconfirmed)

### Prompt 3.1 — Nordic Cleanroom Market Size 🔴 CRITICAL
```
VALIDATE our cleanroom volume estimate: 50-150 tonnes/year of 100% white PET.

OUR ASSUMPTION (UNVERIFIED):
- ~5,400 cleanroom workers in Finland

- = 50-150 t/yr across Nordics

NEED TO CONFIRM:
1. How many cleanroom workers exist in Finland, Sweden, Norway?
2. What is ACTUAL garment consumption per worker? (Our 10 kg may be wrong)
3. What is the standard composition? (99% PET / 1% carbon fiber — verify)
4. What colors are used? (Assume white — verify)
5. What is the CURRENT disposal pathway?

Industries with cleanrooms: Pharma, semiconductor, electronics, food, medical devices, biotech.

CRITICAL: Our entire cleanroom strategy is based on unvalidated estimates.
```

UNVERIFIED CONTACT: Carolina Sved (may be outdated)

Find:
1. How many cleanroom workers does Orion employ?
2. Which facilities have cleanrooms? (Espoo, Turku, Kuopio?)
3. Who manages workwear services? (Internal or textile rental?)
4. What is annual garment consumption?
5. CURRENT sustainability/facilities contact (not historical)

Orion is Finland's largest pharma company — if our cleanroom strategy works, Orion is the anchor.
```
