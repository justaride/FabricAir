**Size:** 67 KB | **Credibility Score:** 23/25 (HIGH)

### Major Competitors for Finnish rPET Feedstock

#### Fashion & Apparel Sector

| Company | rPET Usage | Volume/Scale |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Pure Waste** | 40% rPET + 60% recycled cotton | 650,000 kg recycled since 2013 |
| **Touchpoint** | 80%+ recycled; ReTouch fabric (10%+ Rester) | Major workwear manufacturer |
| **Reima** | 100% recycled insulation, 50% fabrics | Global children's wear |
| **Halti** | 100% rPET softshells | Outdoor/technical wear |
| **Marimekko** | Partnered with Rester for scraps | Exploring closed-loop |

#### Industrial/Technical Sector

| Company | Application | Market |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Ewona (Ewonawool)** | 100% recycled thermal insulation | Building/HVAC |
| **Intermedius** | 100% rPET felts for acoustics, auto | Industrial nonwovens |
| **Dafecor** | Oil absorbent mats, wiping cloths | Industrial maintenance |
| **Inosence Polyol** | rPET polyols for Finnfoam | Construction insulation |

### Feedstock Control Map

| Player | Role | Control Level |
|--------|------|---------------|
| **Rester Oy** | Primary recycler (12,000t combined) | **PRODUCTION** |
| **Lindström** | 2nd largest Rester shareholder + 100% recycling goal | **LOCKED** |
| **IFC (Infinited Fiber)** | 30,000t cellulose plant (takes cotton) | **CELLULOSE** |
| **LSJH** | Feedstock gatekeeper (sorting) | **ALLOCATION** |

### Strategic Implication

> **"Companies positioned now with partnerships (or investments) in these recycling streams will have the advantage in securing recycled polyester. Those 'late to the party' may find the feedstock already cornered."**

**FabricAir Risk:** Lindström has effectively "locked in" Rester capacity via ownership. FabricAir would compete for remaining allocation.

## RD-012: FabricAir Technical Compatibility Assessment

**Size:** 36 KB | **Credibility Score:** 24/25 (HIGH)

### FabricAir Material Requirements

| Specification | Requirement |
|---------------|-------------|
| Fiber composition | **100% polyester (PET)** |
| Fabric weight | **~300 g/m²** |
| Fiber type | Coarse fiber weave |
| Preferred color | **White** (FabricAir Poly = white only) |
| Finish | Low-lint, washable, FR-capable |

### Finnish Workwear Characteristics

| Characteristic | Typical Value | Compatibility |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Composition | **65% PET / 35% Cotton** | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| Fabric weight | 200-300 gsm | ✅ GOOD |
| Fiber type | Coarse, durable | ✅ GOOD |
| Colors | Navy, black, hi-vis | ⚠️ MODERATE |
| Finishes | FR, PU coatings on some | ⚠️ CHALLENGING |

### Compatibility Matrix

| FabricAir Requirement | Finnish Source | Compatibility |
|-----------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **100% PET** | Mostly poly-cotton blends | ⚠️ Requires sorting for pure polyester garments only |
| **~300 g/m²** | 245-300 gsm common | ✅ Compatible |
| **Coarse fiber/yarn** | Recycled fibers are shorter | ✅ Suits thick yarns |
| **White color** | Mostly colored; few white | ⚠️ Need white/light sorting |
| **Minimal finishes** | Some FR, coatings | ⚠️ Exclude treated items |

### Critical Technical Finding

> **"Mechanical recycling cannot separate blended fibers. If a poly-cotton garment is shredded, the output will also be a polyester/cotton mix. This is a critical compatibility issue."**

### Viable Feedstock Sources (100% Polyester)

| Source Type | Color | Suitability |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Fleece jackets (~250 gsm) | Various | ✅ Pure PET |
| Hi-vis vests/rainwear | Neon/white | ✅ Pure PET |
| Hospital white coats | White | ✅ Ideal |
| Hotel linens (if 100% PET) | White | ✅ Ideal |
| Food industry white uniforms | White | ✅ Ideal |

### Recommendation

FabricAir should target:
1. **White, 100% polyester items** (hospital, food industry, hotel)
2. **Pre-sorted by Rester** for composition and color
3. **Exclude FR-treated and PU-coated garments**

## RD-013: Recycled Polyester Fiber Pricing (Europe)

**Size:** 43 KB | **Credibility Score:** 23/25 (HIGH)

### Current Market Prices (2024-2025)

| Grade | European Price | Source |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| **rPET fiber (high-grade)** | **€1.5-2.0/kg** | Industry indices |
| **rPET food-grade pellets** | €1,680/ton (~€1.68/kg) | TexSPACE |
| **Virgin PET staple** | €1,000-1,200/ton (~€1.0-1.2/kg) | ChemAnalyst |
| **Premium vs Virgin** | **+€600-700/ton (+50-70%)** | Market data |

### Price by Quality Tier

| Quality Grade | Price Range | Application |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Clear/white rPET** | Premium (highest) | Textiles, food-grade |
| Light blue rPET | High | Bottles, light textiles |
| Green rPET | Medium | Industrial strapping |
| **Mixed color rPET** | Discount (lowest) | Insulation, dark products |

### Key Price Drivers

1. **Virgin polyester prices** - Lower oil = wider gap with rPET
2. **Feedstock supply** - Limited bottles = higher rPET
3. **Processing costs** - Energy, collection, certification
4. **GRS certification** - Adds overhead but required
5. **Demand pressure** - Brand sustainability targets

### Cost Implications for FabricAir

| Scenario | Estimated Cost | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Virgin polyester fabric | €3-5/m² | ~300gsm base |
| Recycled polyester fabric | €5-8/m² | 50-70% premium |
| Premium white recycled | €6-10/m² | Color sorting adds cost |

> **"rPET in Europe was roughly 70% more expensive than virgin PET... reflecting a sustainability 'green premium' in the market."**

### Contract Recommendations

- **Volume commitments** lower per-kg costs
- **Multi-year agreements** stabilize pricing
- **Price escalation clauses** tied to virgin indices
