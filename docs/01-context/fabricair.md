## Material Requirements for This Project

FabricAir needs high-quality used polyester fibers to supplement their internal process waste.

### Current Situation
- **Process waste (2024)**: ~30 tonnes from cutting
- **Material**: 100% PET textiles
- **Finish distribution**: 80% flame retardant, 30% PU coating, 30% antimicrobial, 20% untreated

### External Feedstock Requirements
| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Material | 100% Polyester (PET) or 100% Polyamide - no blends |
| Weight | ~300 g/m² |
| Fiber type | Coarse, durable fibers |
| Color | White preferred (can be re-dyed) |
| Typical source | Durable workwear, uniforms, cleanroom garments |

### ⚠️ Finnish Market Compatibility Note (P3 Verified)

**Critical Finding:** Most Finnish workwear is **65% polyester / 35% cotton** blends, which are NOT compatible with FabricAir requirements.

| Source Type | Composition | Compatibility |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Standard workwear | 65/35 poly-cotton | ❌ NOT suitable |
| Hospital white coats | 100% polyester | ✅ Compatible |
| Food industry uniforms | 100% polyester | ✅ Compatible |
| Cleanroom garments | 99% PET / 1% carbon | ✅ Compatible |
| Hotel linens | Often 100% PET | ✅ Compatible |
| Technical textiles | 100% polyamide | ✅ Compatible |

**Recommendation:** Target healthcare, food processing, and cleanroom sectors for 100% white polyester or polyamide.

### Recycling Approach
- **Method**: Fiber-to-fiber recycling
- **Priority**: Mechanical (not chemical)
- **Pilot recommendation**: Start with untreated 20% fraction
- **Pricing context**: T2T rPET ~€2,479/t vs virgin ~€950/t (~160% premium)

## Market Position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global ranking | #2 in fabric duct market |
| Estimated revenue (2023) | $180 million USD |
