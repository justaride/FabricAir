## Key Findings Summary

### Market Overview (VERIFIED)
- **Full textile rental market: €350-450 million annually** (verified P1)
- Polyester workwear segment: ~€75-90 million (subset estimate)
- Lindström market share: **~60%** (verified)
- Textile service companies control **~70%** of professional workwear lifecycle
- Centralized collection points through Lindström, Puro, SOL

**⚠️ Technical Compatibility Note (P3):** Most Finnish workwear is 65/35 poly-cotton blends, NOT 100% polyester. FabricAir requires 100% PET items (hospital white coats, food industry uniforms).

## Recommendations for FabricAir

### Priority 1: White Polyester Sources
1. Pharmaceutical cleanroom facilities (Orion, Okmetic)
2. Food processing (Valio, Fazer)
3. Healthcare lab coats (HUS, university hospitals)

### Priority 2: Volume Access
1. Lindström Group - largest aggregator
2. Sakupe Oy - healthcare specialization
3. Rester Oy - direct recycling access

### Challenges
- Healthcare transitioning away from white
- Industrial sector uses non-white colors
- Need to verify mono-material (100% PET) vs. blends
