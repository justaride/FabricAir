## 1. Energy Recovery (Incineration) - 60-61%

**Volume:** ~40,000 tonnes household textiles to mixed waste annually

### What gets incinerated:
| Stream | Volume | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Mixed household waste | Majority | 96%+ of textiles in mixed waste |
| Defence Forces uniforms | 43,000 kg (80% of 53,408 kg) | FR treatments limit recycling |
| Contaminated industrial | Variable | Oil-stained, chemically treated |
| Post-sorting waste | 40% of sorted | Not suitable for recycling |

### Industrial laundry disposal breakdown:
- **71% incinerated**
- 26.7% material recovery
- 1.8% reused
- 0.5% other

---

## 2. Material Recovery & Recycling - 22%

### Processing Infrastructure

| Facility | Capacity | Output |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Rester Oy (Paimio)** | 6,000 tonnes/year | Yarns, technical textiles, insulation |
| **LSJH Paimio** | 12,000 tonnes/year | Sorting for spinning quality |
| **LSJH Turku (planned)** | 15,000 tonnes/year | €20.5M investment |

### Processing outcomes (LSJH 2022):
| Outcome | Percentage | Volume |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Re-sell for reuse | 30% | 859 tonnes nationwide |
| Raw material recovery | 30% | 627 tonnes |
| Waste disposal | 40% | - |

### Quality grades from recycling:
| Grade | Application | Source Material |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Grade A | New yarn production | White workwear (premium) |
| Grade B | Technical textiles | Mixed quality |
| Grade C | Insulation, composites | Lower quality |
| Grade D | Energy recovery | Unsuitable for recycling |

---

## 3. Export - 18%

**Volume:** 15,300 tonnes/year exported

### Export destinations:
- Germany
- Estonia
- Sweden
- Poland
- United States

**Note:** UFF exports 80% of collected textiles to Baltic states and Asia for secondary markets and processing.

## Sector-Specific Disposal Patterns

### Professional Workwear (Highest Quality)

**Lindström Group operations:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| End-of-life workwear volume | ~400 tonnes/year in Finland |
| Repairs before disposal | 4.5-4.9 million pieces/year |
| Pre-partnership disposal | 95% incinerated, 5% recycled |
| Post-Rester partnership | Moving to 100% recycling by 2025 |

**Industrial laundries total:**
- **1,330 tonnes** end-of-life textiles annually

### Healthcare Sector

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Processing volume (Sakupe) | 10 million kg/year |
| Hygiene standard | EN-SFS 14065 |
| Quality | Contamination-free |

### K-Group Retail

- Started textile recycling 2024
- Collects from **20,000+ employees**
- Clean workwear → Rester processing

## Reuse Channels

### Charitable Organizations

| Organization | Volume/Activity | Reuse Rate |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| **UFF** | 12 million kg collected (2023) | 95.5% |
| **Red Cross (Kontti)** | Part of 16,100 tonnes | - |
| **Fida International** | Part of 16,100 tonnes | - |
| **Total reuse from households** | 9,900 tonnes/year | 1.8 kg/inhabitant |

### Reuse rate by collection method:

| Collection Type | Reuse Rate | Notes |
|-----------------|------------|-------|
| Shopping center (HSY pilot) | 60% | High quality |
| Free donation points | Up to 95% | Best quality |
| Traditional waste stations | 21% | Poor quality |
| Paid drop-off | 16% | High contamination |

### Industrial Reuse Model

Professional laundering extends garment life **3-5x** compared to consumer use:
- Average workwear: 50-100 wash cycles before disposal
- 4.5-4.9 million garments repaired annually (Lindström)
- Only garments beyond repair enter recycling
