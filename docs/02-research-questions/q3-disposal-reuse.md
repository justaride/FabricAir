| Defence Forces | 43,000 kg | FR treatments limit recycling |
| Contaminated industrial | Variable | Oil-stained, chemically treated |

**Industrial laundry disposal:**
- 71% incinerated
- 27% material recovery
- 2% reused

## Professional Workwear (Best Quality)

**Lindström operations:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| End-of-life volume | ~400 t/year |
| Repairs/year | 4.5-4.9 million pieces |
| Pre-Rester disposal | 95% incinerated |
| Current target | 100% recycling by 2025 |

**Healthcare (Puro):**
- 45 million items/year
- EN-SFS 14065 hygiene standard
- Contamination-free

## Quality Sources for FabricAir

| Tier | Source | Volume | Quality |
|------|--------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Lindström workwear | ~400 t/yr | Known composition, traceable |
| 2 | Healthcare (Puro) | 2-3k t/yr | Regular replacement |
| 3 | Post-consumer | 86k t/yr | Mixed, contamination risk |

## Key Insight

Professional laundering extends garment life 3-5x compared to consumer use:
- 50-100 wash cycles before disposal
- Only garments beyond repair enter recycling
- Traceable, known material composition
