## Regulatory Summary

Finland is **2 years ahead of EU requirements**, having implemented mandatory textile collection in January 2023. The regulatory landscape is shifting from municipal responsibility to **Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)** expected 2027-2028.

---

## Current Regulations (2023-2025)

### National Legislation

| Regulation | Key Requirement | Effective Date |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Waste Act 646/2011** | Framework law, waste hierarchy | In force |
| **Government Decree 978/2021** | Mandatory separate textile collection | Jan 1, 2023 (households) |
| | | Jul 1, 2022 (businesses) |
| **Landfill Ban (2016)** | No textile landfilling | In force |

### Collection System Requirements

**Municipal (Household) System:**
- Municipalities must provide sufficient regional collection points
- Materials prioritized: reuse → mechanical recycling
- 97% population coverage through 31 waste management areas
- LSJH coordinates national processing

**Business System:**
- Companies must arrange separate collection "as far as possible"
- Companies with >€2,000 annual waste service needs must use **Materiaalitori.fi** platform
- Emergency provision: Can request LSJH services if no commercial options within 2 weeks

### Chemical Safety Requirements

**REACH Regulation:**
| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| SVHC content limit | <0.1% by weight |
| Entry 72, Annex XVII | 33 CMR chemicals restricted in skin-contact textiles |
| Candidate list | 250 substances (as of June 2025) |

**Finnish Standards:**
- SFS-EN 14682: Children's clothing safety
- SFS-EN 71-3: Toy safety (textile components)
- Formaldehyde, azo dyes, nickel, phthalates specifically restricted

---

## EU Regulations Applicable in Finland

| Regulation | Scope |
|------------|-------|
| **REACH (EC) 1907/2006** | Chemical safety for all textiles |
| **Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC (amended 2018/851)** | Separate collection by 2025 |
| **Waste Shipment Regulation (EC) 1013/2006** | Export permits required |

---

## Upcoming Regulations (2025-2030)

### Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)

**Status:** Provisional EU agreement reached **February 19, 2025**

**Timeline:**
| Phase | Date | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| EU directive adoption | 2025 | Formal adoption |
| Transposition period | 2026-2027 | 20 months for national laws |
| Full EPR operational | **2027-2028** | PROs established |
| Micro-enterprise compliance | +12 months | Additional period |

**Key Changes:**

| Aspect | Current (2023-2025) | Future EPR (2027+) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Funding | Municipal taxes | Producer fees |
| Collection management | Municipalities | PROs |
| Cost coverage | Taxpayers | Manufacturers, importers, distributors |

**Eco-Modulation Mechanism:**
Producer fees will vary based on:
- ✓ Durability and product lifetime
- ✓ Recyclability (mono-materials favored)
- ✓ Recycled content percentage
- ✓ Reparability features

> "It is environmentally unsustainable for low-quality clothing to be produced at an ever-increasing rate"
> — Finnish Environment Minister Sari Multala

### Digital Product Passport (2026-2027)

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Format | Mandatory QR codes |
| Content | Lifecycle info, material composition, recycling guidance |
| Implementation | VTT publishing guidelines |

### Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (2027-2028)

| Requirement | Timeline |
|-------------|----------|
| Mandatory durability standards | 2027-2028 |
| Minimum recyclability standards | 2027-2028 |
| Minimum recycled fiber content | TBD |
| Ban on destroying unsold textiles | 2026 (large), 2030 (SMEs) |
| Microplastic prevention (synthetics) | TBD |

### Export Controls (Proposed)

Finland advocates (with Nordic partners) to subject textile waste to **Basel Convention** controls:
- Would require prior informed consent for exports
- Currently 82% of Finnish textile waste processed domestically

---

## Finnish Policy Initiatives

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **Circular Economy Act** | Under development (2024-2025), will replace Waste Act |
| **Green Deal for Circular Economy** | Voluntary, 90 stakeholders engaged |
| **Basel Convention Amendment** | Proposed with Nordic partners |

---

## Operational Requirements

| Requirement | Who | How |
|-------------|-----|-----|
| **Materiaalitori.fi** | Businesses with >€2,000 waste costs | Platform for finding processors |
| **Waste Transfer Documentation** | All textile transport | Required between facilities |
| **End-of-Waste Criteria** | TBD | EU JRC developing standards |

---

## Regulatory Authorities

| Authority | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Ministry of Environment** | Policy coordination, EPR implementation |
| **Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE)** | Technical expertise, monitoring |
| **ELY Centre Pirkanmaa** | EPR implementation monitoring |
| **Tukes** | Chemical safety, product compliance |

## Implications for FabricAir

### Current Opportunities (2023-2025)

| Opportunity | Volume |
|-------------|--------|
| Commercial laundry waste | 1,330 tonnes/year (32% recycled) |
| Defence sector uniforms | 53,408 kg (80% incinerated) |
| B2B recyclers (Rester, Dafecor) | Processing industrial polyester |

### Strategic Considerations

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Quality advantage** | Industrial streams offer mono-material consistency |
| **EPR transition risk** | 2026-2028 will disrupt collection arrangements |
| **Price evolution** | High-quality sorted polyester will become valued commodity |
| **Competition increase** | Fiber-to-fiber recycling priority will drive demand |

### Volume Projections

| Timeframe | Situation |
|-----------|-----------|
| Current | 40,000 tonnes in mixed waste |
| Post-EPR | Significant increase through producer-funded collection |
| 2030 target | 100% domestic processing capacity planned |
