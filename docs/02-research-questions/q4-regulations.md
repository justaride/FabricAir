# Q4: Regulations

> What regulations govern polyester textile disposal/reuse in Finland, and how will they evolve?

**Status:** Verified

---

## Summary

Finland is **2 years ahead of EU** with mandatory textile collection since January 2023. The shift to Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is expected 2027-2028.

---

## Current Regulations

| Regulation | Requirement | Effective |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Waste Act 646/2011 | Waste hierarchy framework | In force |
| Decree 978/2021 | Mandatory textile collection | Jan 2023 |
| Landfill Ban | No textile landfilling | 2016 |
| REACH | Chemical safety | In force |

### Collection Requirements

**Households:** Municipalities must provide regional collection points

**Businesses:** Companies must arrange separate collection; use Materiaalitori.fi for waste services >€2,000/year

---

## Upcoming Regulations

### Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)

| Phase | Date | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| EU directive | 2025 | Formal adoption |
| Transposition | 2026-27 | National laws |
| **Full EPR** | **2027-28** | PROs established |

**Impact:** Costs shift from municipalities to producers (manufacturers, importers, distributors)

### Eco-Modulation

Producer fees will vary based on:
- Durability and lifetime
- Recyclability (mono-materials favored)
- Recycled content percentage
- Reparability

### Other Upcoming Rules

| Regulation | Timeline |
|------------|----------|
| Digital Product Passport | 2026-27 |
| Ecodesign standards | 2027-28 |
| Ban on destroying unsold | 2026 (large), 2030 (SME) |

## Timeline

```
2016  ─── Landfill ban
2023  ─── Mandatory collection (Finland now)
2025  ─── EU directive adoption
2026  ─── Digital Product Passport
2027  ─── EPR transposition complete
2028  ─── Full EPR operational
2030  ─── 100% domestic processing target
```

## Implications for FabricAir

### Opportunities

| Opportunity | Volume |
|-------------|--------|
| Commercial laundry waste | 1,330 t/year (32% recycled) |
| Defence uniforms | 53,400 kg (80% incinerated) |
| B2B recyclers | Processing industrial polyester |

### Strategic Considerations

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Quality advantage | Industrial streams offer mono-material consistency |
| EPR transition | 2026-28 will disrupt collection arrangements |
| Price evolution | Sorted polyester becomes valued commodity |
| Competition | Fiber-to-fiber recycling priority increases demand |

---

## Regulatory Authorities

| Authority | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Ministry of Environment | Policy, EPR implementation |
| SYKE | Technical expertise, monitoring |
| Tukes | Chemical safety, compliance |
