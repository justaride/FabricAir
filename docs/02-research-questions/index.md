## Q1: Sectors & Actors

> **What sectors and actors in Finland use high-quality polyester fibers?**

### Answer

The Finnish textile rental market is **€350-450 million/year**, with polyester workwear representing €75-90 million. However, most workwear uses 65/35 poly-cotton blends which are NOT suitable for FabricAir.

### Best Sources for 100% White Polyester/Polyamide

| Priority | Sector | White % | 100% PET/PA | Key Players |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Pharma/Cleanroom | >90% | Yes | Orion, Okmetic, Murata |
| 2 | Food Processing | 70-80% | Mixed | Valio, Fazer, Atria |
| 3 | Healthcare | ~60% | Often blends | HUS, Terveystalo |

### Key Finding

**Target cleanroom and pharmaceutical sectors** — these provide 100% polyester or polyamide, predominantly white, with consistent quality.

## Q2: Value Chain Stakeholders

> **Who are the main stakeholders in production, use, and reuse of polyester textiles in Finland?**

### Answer

Finland's textile ecosystem includes **200+ companies** with mandatory collection since January 2023 (2 years ahead of EU). The value chain is dominated by a few large players.

### Key Stakeholders by Role

| Role | Key Players | Market Position |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Recycling** | Rester | Only large-scale recycler (LSJH cancelled) |
| **Textile Services** | Lindström, Puro, SOL, Elis | Control ~70% of workwear lifecycle |
| **Manufacturing** | Image Wear, Touchpoint | Workwear production |
| **Research** | VTT, Aalto, Telaketju | Technology development |

### Critical Partnership

```
Touchpoint (51%) → Rester ← Lindström (investor)
```

Rester is majority-owned by Touchpoint, with Lindström as strategic investor.

## Q3: Disposal & Reuse

> **How are polyester textiles disposed of in Finland, and what are reuse levels?**

### Answer

Finland processes **85,770 tonnes/year** of textile waste with less than 1% going to fiber-to-fiber recycling.

### Current Disposal Routes

| Route | Percentage | Volume |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Energy Recovery | 60% | ~51,000 t |
| Material Recovery | 22% | ~19,000 t |
| Export | 18% | ~15,300 t |
| **Fiber-to-Fiber Recycling** | **<1%** | — |

### Key Finding

Professional workwear offers the best quality streams:
- **Lindström:** 400 t/year end-of-life, known composition
- **Puro:** 45 million items/year, healthcare grade
- **Industrial laundries:** 71% currently incinerated (opportunity)

## Q4: Regulations

> **What regulations govern polyester textile disposal/reuse, and how will they evolve?**

### Answer

Finland is **2 years ahead of EU** with mandatory textile collection since January 2023. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is expected 2027-2028.

### Regulatory Timeline

| Date | Regulation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| 2016 | Landfill ban | In force |
| 2023 | Mandatory collection (Finland) | In force |
| 2025 | EU mandatory collection | In force |
| 2026-27 | Digital Product Passport | Upcoming |
| **2027-28** | **EPR full implementation** | **Upcoming** |

### Key Finding

**EPR transition (2027-28) will disrupt current arrangements** — companies will shift from disposing to selling textile waste. Early partnerships secure supply.

## Q5: Initiatives

> **What public and private initiatives exist in Finland for polyester collection and reuse?**

### Answer

Finland has Europe's most advanced textile recycling ecosystem, but infrastructure is limited.

### Critical Update

**LSJH Turku recycling plant CANCELLED (April 2024).** Rester is now Finland's only large-scale recycler.

### Active Initiatives

| Initiative | Type | Status | Role |
|------------|------|--------|------|
| **Rester** | Private | Operational | Primary recycler (6-12k t/yr) |
| **Touchpoint** | Private | Operational | Workwear aggregator |
| **Lindström** | Private | Operational | Volume supplier |
| **LSJH** | Public | Sorting only | Coordination |
| **HSY** | Public | Operational | Collection (1M+ residents) |

### Research & Funding

| Initiative | Budget | Focus |
|------------|--------|-------|
| VTT PESCO-UP | €48M | Polyester-cotton recycling |
| Business Finland | €400M | Clean transition funding |

## Q6: Top 10 Sources

> **The most promising stakeholders for sourcing used high-quality polyester fibers**

### Answer

Based on material compatibility, volume, and accessibility, these are the priority contacts:

### Critical Finding (Phase 2)

**Lindström uses 65:35 poly-cotton blends** — NOT compatible with FabricAir requirements. Downgraded to #9.

## Summary: Key Answers (Phase 2 Updated)

| Question | Key Answer |
|----------|------------|
| Q1 | Target cleanroom/pharma for 100% white PET; avoid 65/35 blends |
| Q2 | Rester is the only recycler; Touchpoint owns majority stake |
| Q3 | 86k t/year textile waste; <1% fiber-to-fiber recycling |
| Q4 | Finland 2 years ahead; EPR 2027-28 will transform market |
| Q5 | LSJH plant cancelled; Rester is now primary recycler |
| Q6 | **Lindström excluded** (65:35 blend); Rester + Puro + Orion are priorities |

### Phase 2 Critical Discovery

**Volume estimate revised down from 5-10k to 350-1,000 t/year** of accessible 100% white polyester. Lindström's 400 t/year is 65:35 blend and not compatible.
