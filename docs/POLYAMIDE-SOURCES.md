# Polyamide Feedstock Sources — Nordic Region

> Mapping 100% polyamide (PA/nylon) sources for FabricAir's circular textiles alongside polyester. FabricAir's Oeko-Tex Certificate #66908 confirms both **100% PET** and **100% Polyamide** are acceptable.

**Status:** Phase 2.2 Research (Dec 2025)

---

## Key Finding

**Polyamide is now an acceptable alternative to polyester.** This expands potential feedstock sources to include sportswear, fishing gear, and industrial textiles — sectors with different collection dynamics than workwear.

---

## Source Overview

| Source Type | Volume Estimate | Purity | Status |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| **Sportswear (Nordic brands)** | 50-200 t/yr | High | Collection needed |
| **Fishing nets/gear (Nofir)** | ~8,000 t/yr (global) | PA6 | Recycling exists |
| **Industrial airbags** | ~10,000 t/yr (Europe) | PA66 | Silicone-coated |
| **Swimwear** | 5-20 t/yr | Mixed | Niche |
| **Cleanroom garments** | 10-30 t/yr | 99%+ PET | Some PA options |

## Fishing Nets and Marine Gear

### Nofir AS (Norway)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Type | Fishing gear collection/recycling |
| Volume | **~8,000 tonnes/year** globally |
| Material | **PA6** (nylon 6) dominant |
| Output | Aquafil ECONYL partnership |
| Location | Headquarters Norway |

**Recycling Pathway:**
```
Fishing nets → Nofir collection → Sorting → Aquafil (Italy) → ECONYL nylon → New products
```

**FabricAir Relevance:** High-volume PA6 source, but requires fiber processing for FabricAir's textile applications. May not match 300 g/m² weight requirement directly.

### Aquafil/ECONYL

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Type | Chemical PA recycling |
| Input | Fishing nets, carpet waste |
| Output | Virgin-quality PA6 |
| Capacity | Large (industrial scale) |
| Location | Slovenia/Italy |

---

## Industrial Polyamide Sources

### Automotive Airbags

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Material | PA66 (nylon 66) |
| Volume (Europe) | **~10,000 tonnes/year** estimated |
| Challenges | Silicone-coated, contamination |
| Collection | Via auto recyclers (Stena, etc.) |

**Note:** Requires decoating/processing — not direct textile feedstock.

### Carpet Tile Backing

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Material | PA6 (backing fibers) |
| Recycling | Interface (US), Aquafil |
| Nordic players | Limited local processing |

---

## Pre-Consumer Cutting Waste

### Joutsen Finland (Bedding)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Type | Duvet/pillow manufacturing |
| Location | Juonikylä, Estonia |
| Waste | **~5 tonnes/year** cutting offcuts |
| Material | **Both polyester AND polyamide** |
| Quality | Very high (production waste) |

**Contact:** info@joutsen.com

### Nordic Sportswear Cutting Waste

Brands like Peak Performance report 95% marker efficiency in cutting — but even 5% loss on large volumes generates significant clean waste:

| Brand | Estimated Cutting Waste | Material |
|-------|------------------------|----------|
| Peak Performance | 1-3 t/yr (estimated) | Mixed PA/PET |
| Haglöfs | 2-5 t/yr (estimated) | Mixed PA/PET |
| Craft | 1-2 t/yr (estimated) | PA-dominant |

---

## Swimwear/Technical Apparel

### Arena (Sweden market)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Material | PA/elastane blends |
| Challenge | Elastane contamination |
| Recycling | Limited — blend issues |

### Speedo (Sweden market)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Material | PA/elastane blends |
| Challenge | Same blend issues |

**Note:** Swimwear typically contains 15-25% elastane — may not meet 100% PA requirement.

---

## Cleanroom Garments (PA Option)

Per Oeko-Tex Certificate #66908, FabricAir can accept 100% polyamide cleanroom garments:

| Provider | PA Products | Processing |
|----------|-------------|------------|
