## 9. Conclusion

### What Was Delivered Well

The FabricAir Finland Research Platform provides **comprehensive, verified, and actionable intelligence** for the Finnish market. The 14-document analysis with source verification exceeds typical research standards. Critical discoveries (LSJH cancellation, blend incompatibility) add significant strategic value.

### What Needs Completion

The NCC project scope explicitly included Sweden and Norway. These markets represent **a critical delivery gap** that should be addressed to meet the full project requirements.

### Recommendation

1. **Accept Finland platform** as complete deliverable for Finland scope
2. **Commission additional research** for Sweden and Norway
3. **Develop implementation framework** with timeline and pilot structure
