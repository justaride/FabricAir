## Summary

| Metric | Initial Score | Reconciled Score |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| **Overall Delivery** | 92% | **75.5%** |
| Market Intelligence | 92% | 88% |
| Actionable Contacts | 66% | 50% |
| FabricAir Fit | 90% | 65% |

**Note:** Initial assessment was optimistic. See [QUALITATIVE-DELIVERY-ASSESSMENT.md](QUALITATIVE-DELIVERY-ASSESSMENT.md) for detailed reconciliation.

## Critical Findings (Phase 2)

| Finding | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Lindström uses 65:35 blends** | 400 t/year volume INCOMPATIBLE |
| **Volume estimate revised** | 5-10k → 350-1,000 t/year |
| **Contact level mismatch** | CEOs provided, operational contacts needed |
| **Rester capacity risk** | Lindström is 2nd largest shareholder |

## Deliverables vs. Requirements

### Original NCC Mission

> "Kartlegge selskaper i Finland, Sverige og Norge som spesialiserer seg på innsamling av brukte polyesterfibre for resirkulering..."

| Requirement | Status | Score |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Finland mapping | Complete | 80% |
| Sweden mapping | Complete | 85% |
| Norway mapping | Complete | 80% |
| 100% polyester sources | **Partial** | 55% |
| Operational contacts | **Weak** | 50% |
| Volume quantification | **Revised down** | 60% |

## Question-by-Question Delivery

| Question | Weight | Score | Status |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Q1: Sectors & Actors | 15% | 65% | Material verification gap |
| Q2: Stakeholders | 15% | 90% | Strong delivery |
| Q3: Disposal & Reuse | 15% | 85% | Data is 4 years old |
| Q4: Regulations | 15% | 95% | Excellent |
| Q5: Initiatives | 15% | 85% | LSJH cancellation discovered |
| Q6: Top 10 + Contacts | **25%** | **50%** | Wrong contact level |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | **75.5%** | |

## What We Delivered Well

| Area | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| Market mapping | Comprehensive 3-country analysis |
| Regulatory timeline | Clear EPR and policy roadmap |
| Critical discoveries | LSJH cancelled, Lindström blends, Rester capacity |
| Value chain | Complete stakeholder ecosystem |
| Nordic expansion | Beyond original Finland scope |

## What We Delivered Poorly

| Area | Gap |
|------|-----|
| Contact level | CEOs/executives instead of operational contacts |
| Material verification | Assumed 100% PET without confirmation |
| Volume estimates | Initial estimates 10x too high |
| Actionable pathways | Market map, not action plan |
| Rester capacity | Unknown available (uncommitted) capacity |

---

## Qualitative Grade

| Dimension | Grade |
|-----------|-------|
| Market Intelligence | A- |
| Regulatory Clarity | A |
| Actionable Contacts | D+ |
| Material Specificity | D |
| Strategic Direction | B+ |
| **Overall** | **C+** |

---

## FabricAir Readiness

| Action | Ready? | Gap |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Contact recyclers | Partial | General emails only |
| Source 100% polyester | No | No confirmed sources |
| Estimate volume | No | Range too wide (350-1,000 t) |
| Understand regulations | Yes | Clear timeline |
| Identify partners | Partial | Right orgs, wrong contacts |

---

## Path to Improved Delivery

### To Reach 85%

| Action | Priority | Score Impact |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Identify 3+ operational contacts | HIGH | +5% |
| Confirm 2+ 100% PET sources | HIGH | +3% |
| Confirm Rester available capacity | HIGH | +2% |
| Update volume estimates | MEDIUM | +2% |

### Desk Research Ceiling: ~85%

The remaining gap (15%+) requires direct industry engagement:
- Sample requests and material testing
- Commercial discussions with recyclers
- Operational contact identification through outreach

---

## Conclusion

**We provided market intelligence, not an action plan.**

FabricAir has a comprehensive map of the Nordic textile recycling landscape but cannot proceed to commercial engagement without:

1. Verifying material composition with manufacturers
2. Identifying operational disposal contacts
3. Confirming Rester's available capacity
4. Requesting samples for quality testing
