| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Finland mapping | Complete (95%) |
| Sweden mapping | Complete (92%) |
| Norway mapping | Complete (88%) |
| Collection companies | 40+ identified |
| High volume capacity | 56-62k t/yr verified |
| Mono-material focus | Compatibility matrix provided |
| Quality standards | Technical matching complete |

## Market Analysis Delivery

| Country | Waste Volume | Recycler | Capacity | Contacts |
|---------|--------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Finland | 85,770 t/yr | Rester | 6-12k t/yr | 15+ |
| Sweden | 80-90k t/yr | Rewin (2027) | 20k t/yr | 10+ |
| Norway | ~100k t/yr | NTG | 30k t/yr | 10+ |

---

## Technical Requirements

| Requirement | Delivered |
|-------------|-----------|
| 100% Polyester (mono) | Compatibility matrix shows 65/35 NOT suitable |
| ~300 g/m² weight | Workwear specs documented |
| Light/white colors | White sources prioritized |
| High volume | 56-62k tonnes/year Nordic capacity |

**Critical Finding:** Most workwear is 65/35 poly-cotton — NOT suitable. Target cleanroom, healthcare, food sectors.
