# Phase 3: Validation & Gap Closure Plan

**Status:** Planning
**Created:** 2025-12-08
**Target:** Close remaining 15% delivery gap

---

## Overview

This plan addresses the gaps identified in the deep analysis (2025-12-08). Current delivery score is **85% (B)** after Phase 2.2 integration. Target is 90%+ through direct validation.

### Gap Summary

| Gap | Current State | Target State | Priority |
|-----|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Rester capacity confirmation | "6-12k t/yr" (unverified available) | Confirmed available capacity | **Critical** |
| Cleanroom/pharma volumes | Estimated 50-150 t/yr | Validated with companies | **High** |
| 2024-2025 disposal data | Using SYKE 2021 (4 years old) | Current year data | **High** |
| Operational contacts | 4 of 40+ at correct level | 15+ operational contacts | **High** |
| Technical quality validation | FabricAir specs assumed compatible | Confirmed material match | **Medium** |
