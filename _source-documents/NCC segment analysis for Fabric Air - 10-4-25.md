1. # Company {#company}

   Fabric Air

2. # Basic facts about the company  {#basic-facts-about-the-company}

* Danish company \- multinational  
* Specializing in fabric-based air dispersion systems that significantly reduce the carbon footprint of ventilation compared to traditional metal ductwork.  
* Their lightweight fabric ducts lower emissions during transport and installation, and their energy-efficient design can cut energy use by up to 40%.   
* Fabric Air is advancing sustainability by developing a take-back system for used textiles in their ventilation systems, ensuring materials are recycled rather than discarded.  
* Plan to incorporate textiles from other industries, further promoting circular economy principles and responsible material use

* **Question 1.4.  Regulations on disposing/reuse**

  What are the regulations in Finland regarding the deposing/reuse of polyester textiles, and how are their expected evolution?

* **Question 1.5. Status of existing initiatives to reuse polyester**

  If there are public and/or private initiatives in Finland to collect and reuse polyester textiles in Finland today, what are their status, their ambition and main contact points?

* **Question 1.6. Most promising sources of polyester fibers**

  Make a list of the (10) most promising stakeholders in Finland that could be a source of used high quality polyester fibers, including the persons responsible for deposing of those fibers.
