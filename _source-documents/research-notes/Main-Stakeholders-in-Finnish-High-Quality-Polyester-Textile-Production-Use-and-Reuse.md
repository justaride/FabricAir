# Main Stakeholders in Finnish High\-Quality Polyester Textile Production, Use and Reuse

## Executive Summary

Finland&#39;s polyester textile ecosystem comprises over 200 companies and multiple research institutions operating across production, use, and reuse sectors\. The ecosystem is characterized by strong circular economy focus, with Finland implementing EU textile collection requirements in 2023, two years ahead of the 2025 mandate \([Zero Waste Europe](https://zerowasteeurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ZWE-EWWR2022-factsheet_Finland-textiles.pdf)\)\.
