# Exhaustive Investigation and Analysis of FabricAir

## Company identification reveals a single global entity

FabricAir represents a single global organization rather than multiple companies sharing the name\. Founded in 1973 as IPS Ventilation under the Electrolux Group in Denmark, the company pioneered the world&#39;s first fabric\-based air distribution system\. [Fabricair \+10](https://www.fabricair.com/us/) After separating from Electrolux in 1997 and experiencing various ownership changes, Brian Refsgaard acquired the company in 2005, transforming it into FabricAir A&#x2F;S\. [Fabricair \+2](https://www.fabricair.com/us/about/history/) The company now operates as a Danish Aktieselskab \(public limited liability company\) with headquarters in Køge, Denmark, manufacturing in Alytus, Lithuania, and 18 subsidiaries across five continents serving over 120 countries\. [Fabricair \+6](https://www.fabricair.com/us/)

## The founding story began with solving a critical problem

The company originated from a collaboration between IPS Dansk Presenning A&#x2F;S \(a tarpaulin manufacturer within Electrolux\) and the Danish Meat Research Institute\. [Fabricair](https://www.fabricair.com/us/about/history/) The first fabric duct installation in 1973 addressed a severe problem in Danish slaughterhouses where metal ductwork created freezing drafts causing high employee sick days\. [ThomasNet \+4](https://www.thomasnet.com/profile/20043580/fabricair.html) The innovative air dispersion sock solution reduced drafts without becoming a bacteria breeding ground, revolutionizing industrial ventilation\. [LinkedIn \+2](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fabricair-a-s) This initial success in meat processing facilities laid the foundation for five decades of continuous innovation\. [Fabricair](https://www.fabricair.com/us/about/history/)

The transformation from IPS Ventilation to FabricAir marked a strategic pivot\. After Electrolux sold the tarpaulin division in 1997, the company experienced ownership by Stavdal ASA \(1998\) and Veidekke construction company \(1999\) before Brian Refsgaard&#39;s 2005 acquisition\. [Fabricair \+3](https://www.fabricair.com/us/about/history/) Refsgaard, who joined in the 1990s as sales and business development manager, implemented a philosophy of &quot;make it better and make it easier,&quot; driving global expansion and technological advancement\.
